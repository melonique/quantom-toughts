The concept of duality arose to name these contradictions.

== History ==

=== Wave-particle duality of light ===
In the late 17th century Sir [[Isaac Newton]] had advocated that light was particles, but [[Christiaan Huygens]] took an opposing wave approach.<ref>Christiaan Huygens, [[iarchive:bub_gb_X9PKaZlChggC|''Traité de la lumiere''...]] (Leiden, Netherlands: Pieter van der Aa, 1690), Chapter 1.</ref> [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]'s [[Young's interference experiment|interference experiments]] in 1801, and [[François Arago]]'s detection of the [[Poisson spot]] in 1819, validated Huygen's wave models.  However the wave model was challenged in 1901 by [[Planck's law]] for [[black-body radiation]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Planck |first=Max |date=1901 |title=Ueber das Gesetz der Energieverteilung im Normalspectrum |journal=Annalen der Physik |language=de |volume=309 |issue=3 |pages=553–563 |doi=10.1002/andp.19013090310|doi-access=free }}</ref> [[Max Planck]] heuristically derived a formula for the observed spectrum by assuming that a hypothetical electrically charged [[Oscillation|oscillator]] in a cavity that contained black-body radiation could only change its [[energy]] in a minimal increment, ''E'', that was proportional to the frequency of its associated [[electromagnetic wave]]. In 1905 [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] interpreted the [[photoelectric effect]] also with discrete energies for photons.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Einstein |first=Albert |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0-691-10250-4 |title=The collected papers of Albert Einstein. 3: The Swiss years: writings, 1909 - 1911: [English translation] |date=1993 |publisher=Princeton Univ. Pr |isbn=978-0-691-10250-4 |location=Princeton, NJ}}</ref> These both indicate particle behavior. Despite confirmation by various experimental observations, the [[photon]] theory (as it came to be called) remained controversial until [[Arthur Compton]] performed a [[Compton effect|series of experiments]] from 1922 to 1924 demonstrating the momentum of light.<ref name="Whittaker2">{{Cite book |last=Whittaker |first=Edmund T. |title=A history of the theories of aether & electricity. 2: The modern theories, 1900 - 1926 |date=1989 |publisher=Dover Publ |isbn=978-0-486-26126-3 |edition=Repr |location=New York}}</ref>{{rp|211}} The experimental evidence of particle-like momentum and energy seemingly contradicted the earlier work demonstrating wave-like interference of light.

=== Wave-particle duality of matter ===
{{Main|Matter wave}}
The contradictory evidence from electrons arrived in the opposite order. Many experiments by [[J. J. Thomson]],<ref name="Whittaker2" />{{rp|I:361}} [[Robert Millikan]],<ref name="Whittaker2" />{{rp|I:89}} and [[Charles Thomson Rees Wilson|Charles Wilson]]<ref name="Whittaker2" />{{rp|I:4}}  among others had shown that free electrons had particle properties, for instance the measurement of their mass by Thompson in 1897.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Thomson |first=J.

Kracklauer, 2004.}}</ref> introduced his theory of [[electron]] waves. He suggested that an electron around a nucleus could be thought of as being a [[standing wave]], and that electrons and all matter could be considered as waves. He merged the idea of thinking about them as particles, and of thinking of them as waves. He proposed that particles are bundles of waves ([[Wave packet|wave packets]]) which move with a [[group velocity]] and have an [[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]]. Both of these depend upon the energy, which in turn connects to the [[Wave vector|wavevector]] and the relativistic formulation of [[Albert Einstein]] a few years before.

Following de Broglie's proposal of wave particle duality of electron, in 1925 to 1926, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] developed the wave equation of motion for electron. This rapidly became part of what was called by [[Erwin Schrödinger]] ''undulatory mechanics'',<ref name="Schroedinger">{{Cite journal |last=Schrödinger |first=E. |date=1926 |title=An Undulatory Theory of the Mechanics of Atoms and Molecules |url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRev.28.1049 |journal=Physical Review |language=en |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=1049–1070 |bibcode=1926PhRv...28.1049S |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.28.1049 |issn=0031-899X}}</ref> now called the [[Schrödinger equation]] or wave mechanics. 

In 1926, [[Max Born]] gave a talk in an Oxford meeting about using the electron diffraction experiments to confirm the wave-particle duality of electron. In his talk, Born cited experimental data from [[Clinton Davisson]] in 1923. It happened that Davisson also attended that talk. Davisson returned his lab in US to switch his experimental focus to test the wave property of electron. <ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gehrenbeck |first=Richard K. |date=1978-01-01 |title=Electron diffraction: fifty years ago |url=https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3001830 |journal=Physics Today |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=34–41 |doi=10.1063/1.3001830 |issn=0031-9228}}</ref>

In 1927, the wave nature were experimentally confirmed for electrons by two experiments. The [[Davisson–Germer experiment]] at Bell Labs measured electrons scattered from Ni metal surfaces.<ref>{{Cite journal | author=[[C. Davisson]] and [[L. H.

Davisson and Thomson were awarded Nobel Prize in 1937 for experimental verification of wave property of electrons by diffraction experiments. <ref>{{Cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1937 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1937/summary/ |access-date=2024-03-18 |website=NobelPrize.org |language=en-US}}</ref> Similar crystal diffraction experiments were soon carried out using beams of helium atoms and hydrogen molecules (by [[Otto Stern]] in 1930s). These experiments further verified the wave behavior is not limited to electrons but a general property for matters in microscopic scale.

== Classical waves and particles ==
Before proceeding further, it is critical to introduce some definitions of waves and particles both in a classical sense and in quantum mechanics.  Waves and particles are two very different models for physical systems, each with an exceptionally large range of application. Classical waves obey the [[wave equation]]; they have continuous values at many points in space that vary with time; their spatial extent can vary with time due to [[diffraction]], and they display [[wave interference]]. Physical systems exhibiting wave behavior and described by the mathematics of wave equations include [[water waves]], [[seismic waves]], [[sound waves]], [[radio waves]], and more.

Classical particles obey [[classical mechanics]]; they have some [[center of mass]] and extent; they follow [[trajectories]] characterized by [[Position (geometry)|positions]] and [[velocities]] that vary over time; in the absence of [[forces]] their trajectories are straight lines. [[Stars]], [[planets]], [[spacecraft]], [[tennis balls]], [[bullets]], [[sand grain]]s: particle models work across a huge scale. Unlike waves, particles do not exhibit interference.

Some experiments on quantum systems show wave-like interference and diffraction; some experiments show particle-like collisions. 

Quantum systems obey wave equations that predict particle probability distributions. These particles are associated with discrete values called [[quantum|quanta]] for properties such as [[Spin (physics)|spin]], [[electric charge]] and [[magnetic moment]]. These particles arrive one at time, randomly, but build up a pattern. The probability that experiments will measure particles at point in space is the square of a complex-number valued wave. Experiments can be designed to exhibit  diffraction and interference of the [[probability amplitude]].<ref name=Messiah/> Thus statistically large numbers of the random particle appearances can display wave-like properties. Similar equations govern collective excitations called [[quasiparticle]]s.

== Electrons behaving as waves and particles ==
{{See also|Double-slit experiment}}
The electron double slit experiment is a textbook demonstration of wave-particle duality.<ref name=FeynmanIII/> A modern version of the experiment is shown schematically in the figure below.

[[File:Roger Bach et al 2013 New J. Phys. 15 033018 Nj458349f1.jpg|Left half: schematic setup for electron double-slit experiment with masking; inset micrographs of slits and mask; Right half: results for slit 1, slit 2 and both slits open.<ref name="Bach Pope Liou Batelaan 2013 p=033018"/>|center|thumb|554x554px]]

Electrons from the source hit a wall with two thin slits. A mask behind the slits can expose either one or open to expose both slits. The results for high electron intensity are shown on the right, first for each slit individually, then with both slits open. With either slit open there is a smooth intensity variation due to diffraction. When both slits are open the intensity oscillates, characteristic of wave interference.

Having observed wave behavior, now change the experiment, lowering the intensity of the electron source until only one or two are detected per second, appearing as individual particles, dots in the video. As shown in the movie clip below, the dots on the detector seem at first to be random. After some time a pattern emerges, eventually forming an alternating sequence of light and dark bands.

While electrons were thought to be particles until their wave properties were discovered; for photons it was the opposite.

where ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]] (6.626×10<sup>−34</sup> J⋅s). Only photons of a high enough frequency (above a certain ''threshold'' value which is the [[work function]]) could knock an electron free. For example, photons of blue light had sufficient energy to free an electron from the metal he used, but photons of red light did not. One photon of light above the threshold frequency could release only one electron; the higher the frequency of a photon, the higher the kinetic energy of the emitted electron, but no amount of light below the threshold frequency could release an electron. Despite confirmation by various experimental observations, the [[photon]] theory (as it came to be called later) remained controversial until [[Arthur Compton]] performed a [[Compton effect|series of experiments]] from 1922 to 1924 demonstrating the momentum of light.<ref name="Whittaker2" />{{rp|211}}

Both discrete (quantized) energies and also momentum are, classically, particle attributes. There are many other examples where photons display particle-type properties, for instance in [[Solar sail|solar sails]], where sunlight could propel a space vehicle and [[laser cooling]] where the momentum is used to slow down (cool) atoms. These are a different aspect of wave-particle duality.

In a "which way" experiment, particle detectors are placed at the slits to determine which slit the electron traveled through. When these detectors are inserted, quantum mechanics predicts that the interference pattern disappears because the detected part of the electron wave has changed (loss of [[Coherence (physics)|coherence]]).<ref name=FeynmanIII/> Many similar [[Wheeler's delayed-choice experiment |proposals]] have been made and many have been converted into experiments and tried out.<ref name="MaKoflerZeilinger">{{Cite journal |last1=Ma |first1=Xiao-song |last2=Kofler |first2=Johannes |last3=Zeilinger |first3=Anton |date=2016-03-03 |title=Delayed-choice gedanken experiments and their realizations |url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/RevModPhys.88.015005 |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |language=en |volume=88 |issue=1 |page=015005 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.88.015005 |issn=0034-6861|arxiv=1407.2930 |s2cid=34901303 }}</ref> Every single one shows the same result: as soon as electron trajectories are detected, interference disappears.

A simple example of these "which way" experiments uses a [[Mach–Zehnder interferometer]], a device based on lasers and mirrors sketched below.<ref name=SchneiderLaPuma>{{Cite journal |last1=Schneider |first1=Mark B. |last2=LaPuma |first2=Indhira A. |date=2002-03-01 |title=A simple experiment for discussion of quantum interference and which-way measurement |url=https://digital.grinnell.edu/islandora/object/grinnell%3A47/datastream/OBJ/download/A_Simple_Experiment_for_Discussion_of_Quantum_Interference_and_Which-Way_Measurement.pdf |journal=American Journal of Physics |language=en |volume=70 |issue=3 |pages=266–271 |doi=10.1119/1.1450558 |issn=0002-9505}}</ref>

A laser beam along the input port splits at a half-silvered mirror. Part of the beam continues straight, passes though a glass [[quarter wave plate| phase shifter]], then reflects downward. The other part of the beam reflects from the first mirror then turns at another mirror. The two beams meet at a second half-silvered beam splitter.  

Each output port has a camera to record the results. The two beams show interference characteristic of wave propagation. If the laser intensity is turned sufficiently low, individual dots appear on the cameras, building up the pattern as in the electron example.<ref name=SchneiderLaPuma/>

The first beam-splitter mirror acts like double slits, but in the interferometer case we can remove the second beam splitter. Then the beam heading down ends up in output port 1: any photon particles on this path gets counted in that port. The beam going across the top ends up on output port 2. In either case the counts will track the photon trajectories. However, as soon as the second beam splitter is removed the interference pattern disappears.<ref name=SchneiderLaPuma/>
