'''Lamarckism''', also known as '''Lamarckian inheritance''' or '''neo-Lamarckism''',<ref name=Ghiselin1994/> is the notion that an [[organism]] can pass on to its [[offspring]] physical characteristics that the parent organism acquired through use or disuse during its lifetime. It is also called the '''inheritance of acquired characteristics''' or more recently '''soft inheritance'''. The idea is named after the French [[zoologist]] [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] (1744–1829), who incorporated the [[classical era]] theory of soft inheritance into his theory of evolution as a supplement to his concept of [[orthogenesis]], a drive towards [[Evolution of biological complexity|complexity]].

Introductory textbooks contrast Lamarckism with [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]]. However, Darwin's book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' gave credence to the idea of heritable effects of use and disuse, as Lamarck had done, and his own concept of [[pangenesis]] similarly implied soft inheritance.<ref name=Ghiselin1994/><ref name=Gould2002p177/>

Many researchers from the 1860s onwards attempted to find evidence for Lamarckian inheritance, but these have all been explained away,<!--<ref name="Delage 1912 210"/><ref name="Kohler 2002 202–204"/><ref name="Mitman 1992 219"/>--><ref name="Bowler 2003 245–246"/><ref name="Medawar 1985 168"/> either by other mechanisms such as genetic contamination or as [[fraud]]. [[August Weismann]]'s experiment, considered definitive in its time, is now considered to have failed to disprove Lamarckism, as it did not address use and disuse. Later, [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian genetics]] supplanted the notion of inheritance of acquired traits, eventually leading to the development of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]], and the general abandonment of Lamarckism in [[biology]]. Despite this, interest in Lamarckism has continued.

Since {{Circa|2000}} new experimental results in the fields of [[epigenetics]], [[genetics]], and [[somatic hypermutation]] proved the possibility of [[transgenerational epigenetic inheritance]] of traits acquired by the previous generation. These proved a limited validity of Lamarckism. The inheritance of the [[hologenome]], consisting of the genomes of all an organism's symbiotic microbes as well as its own genome, is also somewhat Lamarckian in effect, though entirely Darwinian in its mechanisms.

==Early history==
===Origins===
[[File:Jean-baptiste lamarck2.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] repeated the ancient folk wisdom of the inheritance of acquired characteristics.]]

The inheritance of acquired characteristics was proposed in ancient times and remained a current idea for many centuries. The historian of science [[Conway Zirkle]] wrote in 1935 that:<ref name=Zirkle1935/>

{{quote|Lamarck was neither the first nor the most distinguished biologist to believe in the inheritance of acquired characters. He merely endorsed a belief which had been generally accepted for at least 2,200 years before his time and used it to explain how evolution could have taken place. The inheritance of acquired characters had been accepted previously by [[Hippocrates]], [[Aristotle]], [[Galen]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Jerome Cardan]], [[Levinus Lemnius]], [[John Ray]], [[Michel Adanson|Michael Adanson]], [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach|Jo. Fried. Blumenbach]] and [[Erasmus Darwin]] among others.<ref name=Zirkle1935>{{cite journal |last=Zirkle |first=Conway |author-link=Conway Zirkle | year=1935 |title=The Inheritance of Acquired Characters and the Provisional Hypothesis of Pangenesis |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=69 |issue=724 |pages=417–445 |doi=10.1086/280617 |s2cid=84729069 }}</ref>}}

Zirkle noted that Hippocrates described [[pangenesis]], the theory that what is inherited derives from the whole body of the parent, whereas Aristotle thought it impossible; but that all the same, Aristotle implicitly agreed to the inheritance of acquired characteristics, giving the example of the inheritance of a scar, or of blindness, though noting that children do not always resemble their parents. Zirkle recorded that [[Pliny the Elder]] thought much the same. Zirkle pointed out that stories involving the idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics appear numerous times in ancient mythology and the Bible, and persisted through to [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[Just So Stories]]''.<ref name="Zirkle 1946" /> The idea is mentioned in 18th century sources such as [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]]'s ''[[D'Alembert's Dream]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Diderot |first1=Denis |last2=Ballestero |first2=Manuel |title=El sueño de D'Alembert; y Suplemento al viaje de Bougainville |date=1992 |publisher=Debate |isbn=84-7444-583-3 |edition=First |location=Madrid |oclc=433436276}}</ref> Erasmus Darwin's ''[[Zoonomia]]'' (c. 1795) suggested that [[warm-blooded]] [[animal]]s develop from "one living filament... with the power of acquiring new parts" in response to stimuli, with each round of "improvements" being inherited by successive generations.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1794–1796|loc=[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15707/15707-h/15707-h.htm#sect_XXXIX Vol I, section XXXIX]}}</ref>

===Darwin's pangenesis===
[[File:Darwin's Pangenesis.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Charles Darwin]]'s [[pangenesis]] theory. Every part of the body emits tiny gemmules which migrate to the [[gonad]]s and contribute to the next generation via the fertilised egg. Changes to the body during an organism's life would be inherited, as in Lamarckism.]]
{{main|Pangenesis}}

[[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' proposed natural selection as the main mechanism for development of species, but (like Lamarck) gave credence to the idea of heritable effects of use and disuse as a supplementary mechanism.<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=617}}: "But Darwin was {{sic|hide=y|loath}} to let go of the notion that a well-used and strengthened organ could be inherited."</ref> Darwin subsequently set out his concept of pangenesis in the final chapter of his book ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication]]'' (1868), which gave numerous examples to demonstrate what he thought was the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Pangenesis, which he emphasised was a hypothesis, was based on the idea that [[somatic cell]]s would, in response to environmental stimulation (use and disuse), throw off '[[Gemmule (pangenesis)|gemmules]]' or 'pangenes' which travelled around the body, though not necessarily in the [[Circulatory system|bloodstream]]. These pangenes were microscopic particles that supposedly contained information about the characteristics of their parent cell, and Darwin believed that they eventually accumulated in the [[germ cell]]s where they could pass on to the next generation the newly acquired characteristics of the parents.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Darwin |first=Charles |author-link=Charles Darwin |date=April 27, 1871 |title=Pangenesis |journal=Nature |volume=3 |issue=78 |pages=502–503 |bibcode=1871Natur...3..502D |doi=10.1038/003502a0|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Holterhoff, Kate |s2cid=207150548 |date=2014 |title=The History and Reception of Charles Darwin's Hypothesis of Pangenesis |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=661–695 |doi=10.1007/s10739-014-9377-0|pmid=24570302 }}</ref>

Darwin's half-cousin, [[Francis Galton]], carried out experiments on [[rabbit]]s, with Darwin's cooperation, in which he transfused the [[blood]] of one variety of rabbit into another variety in the expectation that its offspring would show some characteristics of the first. They did not, and Galton declared that he had disproved Darwin's hypothesis of pangenesis, but Darwin objected, in a letter to the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', that he had done nothing of the sort, since he had never mentioned blood in his writings. He pointed out that he regarded pangenesis as occurring in [[protozoa]] and [[plant]]s, which have no blood, as well as in animals.<ref name=Liu2008>{{Cite journal |last=Liu |first=Yongsheng |s2cid=39953275 |date=2008 |title=A new perspective on Darwin's Pangenesis |journal=Biological Reviews |volume=83 |issue=2 |pages=141–149 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.2008.00036.x|pmid=18429766 }}</ref>

===Lamarck's evolutionary framework===

[[File:Lamarck's Two-Factor Theory.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Lamarck's two-factor theory involves 1) a complexifying force that drives animal [[body plan]]s towards higher levels ([[orthogenesis]]) creating a ladder of [[phylum|phyla]], and 2) an adaptive force that causes animals with a given body plan to adapt to circumstances (use and disuse, inheritance of acquired characteristics), creating a diversity of [[species]] and [[genus|genera]]. Lamarckism is the name now widely used for the adaptive force.]]
{{further|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck#Lamarckian evolution}}

Between 1800 and 1830, Lamarck proposed a systematic theoretical framework for understanding evolution. He saw evolution as comprising four laws:<ref name="Larson2004">{{cite book |author=Larson, Edward J. |date=2004 |title=A Growing sense of progress |work=Evolution: The remarkable history of a Scientific Theory |publisher=Modern Library |pages=38–41}}</ref><ref name="Gould2001">{{cite book | last=Gould | first=Stephen | title=The lying stones of Marrakech : penultimate reflections in natural history | publisher=Vintage | year=2001 | isbn=978-0-09-928583-0 | pages=119–121}}</ref>

# "Life by its own force, tends to increase the volume of all organs which possess the force of life, and the force of life extends the dimensions of those parts up to an extent that those parts bring to themselves;"
# "The production of a new organ in an animal body, results from a new requirement arising. and which continues to make itself felt, and a new movement which that requirement gives birth to, and its upkeep/maintenance;"
# "The development of the organs, and their ability, are constantly a result of the use of those organs."
# "All that has been acquired, traced, or changed, in the physiology of individuals, during their life, is conserved through the genesis, reproduction, and transmitted to new individuals who are related to those who have undergone those changes."

===Lamarck's discussion of heredity===

In 1830, in an aside from his evolutionary framework, Lamarck briefly mentioned two traditional ideas in his discussion of heredity, in his day considered to be generally true. The first was the idea of use versus disuse; he theorized that individuals lose characteristics they do not require, or use, and develop characteristics that are useful. The second was to argue that the acquired traits were heritable. He gave as an imagined illustration the idea that when [[giraffe]]s stretch their necks to reach leaves high in trees, they would strengthen and gradually lengthen their necks. These giraffes would then have offspring with slightly longer necks. In the same way, he argued, a [[blacksmith]], through his work, strengthens the muscles in his arms, and thus his sons would have similar muscular development when they mature. Lamarck stated the following two laws:<ref name=Lamarck1830/>

# ''Première Loi: Dans tout animal qui n' a point dépassé le terme de ses développemens, l' emploi plus fréquent et soutenu d' un organe quelconque, fortifie peu à peu cet organe, le développe, l' agrandit, et lui donne une puissance proportionnée à la durée de cet emploi; tandis que le défaut constant d' usage de tel organe, l'affoiblit insensiblement, le détériore, diminue progressivement ses facultés, et finit par le faire disparoître.''<ref name=Lamarck1830/>
# ''Deuxième Loi: Tout ce que la nature a fait acquérir ou perdre aux individus par l' influence des circonstances où leur race se trouve depuis long-temps exposée, et, par conséquent, par l' influence de l' emploi prédominant de tel organe, ou par celle d' un défaut constant d' usage de telle partie; elle le conserve par la génération aux nouveaux individus qui en proviennent, pourvu que les changemens acquis soient communs aux deux sexes, ou à ceux qui ont produit ces nouveaux individus.''<ref name=Lamarck1830>{{harvnb|Lamarck|1830|loc=[http://www.lamarck.cnrs.fr/ice/ice_page_detail.php?lang=fr&type=text&bdd=lamarck&table=ouvrages_lamarck&bookId=29&search=no&typeofbookDes=Livres&facsimile=off&pageOrder=260 p. 235]}}</ref>

English translation:

# First Law [Use and Disuse]: In every animal which has not passed the limit of its development, a more frequent and continuous use of any organ gradually strengthens, develops and enlarges that organ, and gives it a power proportional to the length of time it has been so used; while the permanent disuse of any organ imperceptibly weakens and deteriorates it, and progressively diminishes its functional capacity, until it finally disappears.
# Second Law [Soft Inheritance]: All the acquisitions or losses wrought by nature on individuals, through the influence of the environment in which their race has long been placed, and hence through the influence of the predominant use or permanent disuse of any organ; all these are preserved by reproduction to the new individuals which arise, provided that the acquired modifications are common to both sexes, or at least to the individuals which produce the young.<ref>{{harvnb|Lamarck|1914|p=113}}</ref>

In essence, a change in the environment brings about change in "needs" (''besoins''), resulting in change in behaviour, causing change in organ usage and development, bringing change in form over time—and thus the gradual [[Transmutation of species|transmutation of the species]]. The evolutionary biologists and historians of science Conway Zirkle, [[Michael Ghiselin]], and [[Stephen Jay Gould]] have pointed out, these ideas were not original to Lamarck.<ref name=Zirkle1935/><ref name=Ghiselin1994/><ref>{{harvnb|Gould|2002|pp=170–191}}</ref>

===Weismann's experiment===
[[File:Weismann's Germ Plasm.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|[[August Weismann]]'s [[germ plasm]] theory. The hereditary material, the germ plasm, is confined to the [[gonad]]s and the [[gamete]]s. Somatic cells (of the body) [[embryology|develop]] afresh in each generation from the germ plasm, creating an invisible "[[Weismann barrier]]" to Lamarckian influence from the soma to the next generation.]]

[[August Weismann]]'s [[germ plasm]] theory held that germline cells in the [[gonad]]s contain information that passes from one generation to the next, unaffected by experience, and independent of the somatic (body) cells. This implied what came to be known as the [[Weismann barrier]], as it would make Lamarckian inheritance from changes to the body difficult or impossible.<ref name="Romanes 1893">{{cite book |last=Romanes |first=George John |title=An examination of Weismannism |publisher=Open Court |year=1893 |ol=23380098M }}</ref>

Weismann conducted the experiment of removing the tails of 68 [[Laboratory mouse|white mice]], and those of their offspring over five generations, and reporting that no mice were born in consequence without a tail or even with a shorter tail. In 1889, he stated that "901 young were produced by five generations of artificially mutilated parents, and yet there was not a single example of a rudimentary tail or of any other abnormality in this organ."<ref>{{harvnb|Weismann|1889|loc="The Supposed Transmission of Mutilations" (1888), [http://www.esp.org/books/weismann/essays/facsimile/contents/weismann-essays-1-ch08.pdf#page=14 p. 432]}}</ref> The experiment, and the theory behind it, were thought at the time to be a refutation of Lamarckism.<ref name="Romanes 1893"/>

The experiment's effectiveness in refuting Lamarck's hypothesis is doubtful, as it did not address the ''use and disuse'' of characteristics in response to the environment. The biologist Peter Gauthier noted in 1990 that:<ref name="Gauthier 1990"/>

{{quote|Can Weismann's experiment be considered a case of disuse? Lamarck proposed that when an organ was not used, it slowly, and very gradually atrophied. In time, over the course of many generations, it would gradually disappear as it was inherited in its modified form in each successive generation. Cutting the tails off mice does not seem to meet the qualifications of disuse, but rather falls in a category of accidental misuse... Lamarck's hypothesis has never been proven experimentally and there is no known mechanism to support the idea that somatic change, however acquired, can in some way induce a change in the germplasm. On the other hand it is difficult to disprove Lamarck's idea experimentally, and it seems that Weismann's experiment fails to provide the evidence to deny the Lamarckian hypothesis, since it lacks a key factor, namely the willful exertion of the animal in overcoming environmental obstacles.<ref name="Gauthier 1990">{{cite journal |last=Gauthier |first=Peter |date=March–May 1990 |title=Does Weismann's Experiment Constitute a Refutation of the Lamarckian Hypothesis? |journal=BIOS |volume=61 |number=1/2 |pages=6–8 |jstor=4608123}}</ref>}}

Ghiselin also considered the Weismann tail-chopping experiment to have no bearing on the Lamarckian hypothesis, writing in 1994 that:<ref name="Ghiselin1994"/>

<blockquote>The acquired characteristics that figured in Lamarck's thinking were changes that resulted from an individual's own drives and actions, not from the actions of external agents. Lamarck was not concerned with wounds, injuries or mutilations, and nothing that Lamarck had set forth was tested or "disproven" by the Weismann tail-chopping experiment.<ref name="Ghiselin1994"/></blockquote>

The historian of science Rasmus Winther stated that Weismann had nuanced views about the role of the environment on the germ plasm. Indeed, like Darwin, he consistently insisted that a variable environment was necessary to cause variation in the hereditary material.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Winther |first=Rasmus |s2cid=23808208 |title=August Weismann on Germ-Plasm Variation |journal=Journal of the History of Biology|date=2001|volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=517–555 |doi=10.1023/A:1012950826540 |pmid=11859887}}</ref>

==Textbook Lamarckism==
[[File:Giraffe feeding, Tanzania.jpg|thumb|The long neck of the [[giraffe]] is often used as an example in popular explanations of Lamarckism. However, this was only a small part of his theory of evolution towards "perfection"; it was a hypothetical illustration; and he used it to discuss his theory of heredity, not evolution.<ref name="Ghiselin1994"/>]]

The identification of Lamarckism with the inheritance of acquired characteristics is regarded by evolutionary biologists including Ghiselin as a falsified artifact of the subsequent history of evolutionary thought, repeated in textbooks without analysis, and wrongly contrasted with a falsified picture of Darwin's thinking. Ghiselin notes that "Darwin accepted the inheritance of acquired characteristics, just as Lamarck did, and Darwin even thought that there was some experimental evidence to support it."<ref name=Ghiselin1994>{{cite journal |last1=Ghiselin |first1=Michael T. |title=The Imaginary Lamarck: A Look at Bogus "History" in Schoolbooks |url=http://www.textbookleague.org/54marck.htm |journal=The Textbook Letter |issue=September–October 1994 |date=1994 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001012042617/http://www.textbookleague.org/54marck.htm |archive-date=12 October 2000 |url-status=dead |access-date=17 February 2006 }}</ref> Gould wrote that in the late 19th century, evolutionists "re-read Lamarck, cast aside the guts of it ... and elevated one aspect of the mechanics—inheritance of acquired characters—to a central focus it never had for Lamarck himself."<ref>{{harvnb|Gould|1980|p=66}}</ref> He argued that "the restriction of 'Lamarckism' to this relatively small and non-distinctive corner of Lamarck's thought must be labelled as more than a misnomer, and truly a discredit to the memory of a man and his much more comprehensive system."<ref name=Gould2002p177>{{harvnb|Gould|2002|pp=177–178}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |author-link=Stephen Jay Gould |date=October 4, 1979 |title=Another Look at Lamarck |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kHHYOtogBEgC&pg=PA38 |magazine=[[New Scientist]] |volume=84 |issue=1175 |pages=38–40 |access-date=2015-11-09}}</ref>

==Neo-Lamarckism==

===Context===
{{further|Eclipse of Darwinism|Orthogenesis}}
[[File:PSM V49 D527 Edward Drinker Cope.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Edward Drinker Cope]]]]

The period of the [[history of evolutionary thought]] between Darwin's death in the 1880s, and the foundation of [[population genetics]] in the 1920s and the beginnings of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s, is called [[the eclipse of Darwinism]] by some historians of science. During that time many scientists and philosophers accepted the reality of evolution but doubted whether natural selection was the main evolutionary mechanism.<ref>{{harvnb|Quammen|2006|p=216}}</ref>

Among the most popular alternatives were theories involving the inheritance of characteristics acquired during an organism's lifetime. Scientists who felt that such Lamarckian mechanisms were the key to evolution were called neo-Lamarckians. They included the British [[Botany|botanist]] [[George Henslow]] (1835–1925), who studied the effects of environmental stress on the growth of plants, in the belief that such environmentally-induced variation might explain much of [[plant evolution]], and the American entomologist [[Alpheus Spring Packard|Alpheus Spring Packard, Jr.]], who studied blind animals living in caves and wrote a book in 1901 about Lamarck and his work.<ref name="Bowler236_244">{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=236–244}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Quammen|2006|pp=218, 220}}</ref> Also included were paleontologists like [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Alpheus Hyatt]], who observed that the fossil record showed orderly, almost linear, patterns of development that they felt were better explained by Lamarckian mechanisms than by natural selection. Some people, including Cope and the Darwin critic [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], felt that inheritance of acquired characteristics would let organisms shape their own evolution, since organisms that acquired new habits would change the use patterns of their organs, which would kick-start Lamarckian evolution. They considered this philosophically superior to Darwin's mechanism of random variation acted on by selective pressures. Lamarckism also appealed to those, like the philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]] and the German anatomist [[Ernst Haeckel]], who saw evolution as an inherently progressive process.<ref name="Bowler236_244" /> The German [[Zoology|zoologist]] [[Theodor Eimer]] combined Larmarckism with ideas about [[orthogenesis]], the idea that evolution is directed towards a goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Quammen|2006|p=221}}</ref>

With the development of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of the theory of evolution, and a lack of evidence for a mechanism for acquiring and passing on new characteristics, or even their heritability, Lamarckism largely fell from favour. Unlike [[neo-Darwinism]], neo-Lamarckism is a loose grouping of largely heterodox theories and mechanisms that emerged after Lamarck's time, rather than a coherent body of theoretical work.<ref name=Bowler1989Demise>{{Cite book |title=Evolution: The History of an Idea |last=Bowler |first=Peter J. |publisher=University of California Press |year=1989 |orig-year=1983 |edition=Revised |isbn=978-0520063860 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/evolutionhistory0000bowl/page/257 257, 264, 279–280] |url=https://archive.org/details/evolutionhistory0000bowl/page/257 }}</ref>

===19th century===

[[File:Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard]] tried to demonstrate Lamarckism by mutilating [[guinea pig]]s.]]

Neo-Lamarckian versions of evolution were widespread in the late 19th century. The idea that living things could to some degree choose the characteristics that would be inherited allowed them to be in charge of their own destiny as opposed to the Darwinian view, which placed them at the mercy of the environment. Such ideas were more popular than natural selection in the late 19th century as it made it possible for biological evolution to fit into a framework of a divine or naturally willed plan, thus the neo-Lamarckian view of evolution was often advocated by proponents of orthogenesis.<ref>{{harvnb|Bowler|1992}}</ref> According to the historian of science Peter J. Bowler, writing in 2003:

{{blockquote|One of the most emotionally compelling arguments used by the neo-Lamarckians of the late nineteenth century was the claim that Darwinism was a mechanistic theory which reduced living things to puppets driven by heredity. The selection theory made life into a game of Russian roulette, where life or death was predetermined by the genes one inherited. The individual could do nothing to mitigate bad heredity. Lamarckism, in contrast, allowed the individual to choose a new habit when faced with an environmental challenge and shape the whole future course of evolution.<ref>{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|p=367}}</ref>}}

Scientists from the 1860s onwards conducted numerous experiments that purported to show Lamarckian inheritance. Some examples are described in the table.

A century after Lamarck, scientists and philosophers continued to seek mechanisms and evidence for the inheritance of acquired characteristics.

===Late 20th century===
The British anthropologist [[Frederic Wood Jones]] and the South African paleontologist [[Robert Broom]] supported a neo-Lamarckian view of human evolution.<!--so?--> The German anthropologist [[Hermann Klaatsch]] relied on a neo-Lamarckian model of evolution to try and explain the origin of [[bipedalism]]. Neo-Lamarckism remained influential in biology until the 1940s when the role of natural selection was reasserted in evolution as part of the modern evolutionary synthesis.<ref>{{harvnb|Wood|2013}}</ref>
[[Herbert Graham Cannon]], a British zoologist, defended Lamarckism in his 1959 book ''Lamarck and Modern Genetics''.<ref>{{harvnb|Cannon|1975}}</ref> In the 1960s, "biochemical Lamarckism" was advocated by the embryologist [[Paul Wintrebert]].<ref>{{harvnb|Boesiger|1974|p=29}}</ref>

Neo-Lamarckism was dominant in French biology for more than a century.<!--so?--> French scientists who supported neo-Lamarckism included [[Edmond Perrier]] (1844–1921), [[Alfred Mathieu Giard|Alfred Giard]] (1846–1908), [[Gaston Bonnier]] (1853–1922) and [[Pierre-Paul Grassé]] (1895–1985). They followed two traditions, one mechanistic, one [[vitalism|vitalistic]] after [[Henri Bergson]]'s [[Élan vital|philosophy of evolution]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Loison |first=Laurent |s2cid=3398698 |date=November 2011 |title=French Roots of French Neo-Lamarckisms, 1879–1985 |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=713–744 |doi=10.1007/s10739-010-9240-x |pmid=20665089}}</ref>

In 1987, [[Ryuichi Matsuda]] coined the term "pan-environmentalism" for his evolutionary theory which he saw as a fusion of [[Darwinism]] with neo-Lamarckism. He held that [[heterochrony]] is a main mechanism for evolutionary change and that novelty in evolution can be generated by [[genetic assimilation]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pearson |first=Roy Douglas |date=March 1988 |title=Reviews |journal=Acta Biotheoretica |type=Book review |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=31–36 |doi=10.1007/BF00050806}} Book reviews of ''Animal Evolution in Changing Environments: With Special Reference to Abnormal Metamorphosis'' (1987) by [[Ryuichi Matsuda]] and ''The Evolution of Individuality'' (1987) by [[Leo Buss|Leo W.

Shapiro]] for providing no solid evidence for his theory. Shapiro noted that "Matsuda himself accepts too much at face value and is prone to wish-fulfilling interpretation."<ref name="Shapiro 1988" />

===Ideological neo-Lamarckism===
[[File:Trofim Lysenko portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Trofim Lysenko]] promoted an [[Lysenkoism|ideological form of neo-Lamarckism]] which adversely influenced [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agricultural policy in the 1930s.]]

{{main|Lysenkoism}}

A form of Lamarckism was revived in the [[Soviet Union]] of the 1930s when [[Trofim Lysenko]] promoted the ideologically driven research programme, [[Lysenkoism]]; this suited the ideological opposition of [[Joseph Stalin]] to [[genetics]]. Lysenkoism influenced Soviet agricultural policy which in turn was later blamed for the numerous massive crop failures experienced within Soviet states.<ref>{{harvnb|Baird|Scerri|McIntyre|2006|p=166}}</ref>

===Critique===
[[George Gaylord Simpson]] in his book ''[[Tempo and Mode in Evolution]]'' (1944) claimed that experiments in heredity have failed to corroborate any Lamarckian process.<ref>{{harvnb|Simpson|1944|p=75}}</ref> Simpson noted that neo-Lamarckism "stresses a factor that Lamarck rejected: inheritance of direct effects of the environment" and neo-Lamarckism is closer to Darwin's pangenesis than Lamarck's views.<ref>{{harvnb|Simpson|1964|pp=14–60}}</ref> Simpson wrote, "the inheritance of acquired characters, failed to meet the tests of observation and has been almost universally discarded by biologists."<ref>{{harvnb|Simpson|1965|p=451}}</ref>

Zirkle pointed out that Lamarck did not originate the hypothesis that [[Inheritance of acquired characteristics|acquired characteristics could be inherited]], so it is incorrect to refer to it as Lamarckism:

<blockquote>What Lamarck really did was to accept the hypothesis that acquired characters were heritable, a notion which had been held almost universally for well over two thousand years and which his contemporaries accepted as a matter of course, and to assume that the results of such inheritance were cumulative from generation to generation, thus producing, in time, new species. His individual contribution to biological theory consisted in his application to the problem of the origin of species of the view that acquired characters were inherited and in showing that evolution could be inferred logically from the accepted biological hypotheses. He would doubtless have been greatly astonished to learn that a belief in the inheritance of acquired characters is now labeled "Lamarckian," although he would almost certainly have felt flattered if evolution itself had been so designated.<ref name="Zirkle 1946">{{cite journal |last=Zirkle |first=Conway |author-link=Conway Zirkle |date=January 1946 |title=The Early History of the Idea of the Inheritance of Acquired Characters and of Pangenesis |journal=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=91–151 |doi=10.2307/1005592 |jstor=1005592}}</ref></blockquote>

[[Peter Medawar]] wrote regarding Lamarckism, "very few professional biologists believe that anything of the kind occurs—or can occur—but the notion persists for a variety of nonscientific reasons." Medawar stated there is no known mechanism by which an adaptation acquired in an individual's lifetime can be imprinted on the genome and Lamarckian inheritance is not valid unless it excludes the possibility of natural selection, but this has not been demonstrated in any experiment.<ref>{{harvnb|Medawar|1985|pp=166–169}}</ref>

[[Martin Gardner]] wrote in his book ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]'' (1957):

<blockquote>A host of experiments have been designed to test Lamarckianism. All that have been verified have proved negative. On the other hand, tens of thousands of experiments— reported in the journals and carefully checked and rechecked by geneticists throughout the world— have established the correctness of the gene-mutation theory beyond all reasonable doubt... In spite of the rapidly increasing evidence for natural selection, Lamarck has never ceased to have loyal followers.... There is indeed a strong emotional appeal in the thought that every little effort an animal puts forth is somehow transmitted to his progeny.<ref>{{harvnb|Gardner|1957|pp=142–143}}</ref></blockquote>

According to Ernst Mayr, any Lamarckian theory involving the inheritance of acquired characters has been refuted as "[[DNA]] does not directly participate in the making of the phenotype and that the phenotype, in turn, does not control the composition of the DNA."<ref>{{harvnb|Mayr|1997|p=222}}: "...the recognition that DNA does not directly participate in the making of the phenotype and that the phenotype, in turn, does not control the composition of the DNA represents the ultimate invalidation of all theories involving the inheritance of acquired characters. This definitive refutation of Lamarck's theory of evolutionary causation clears the air."</ref> Peter J. Bowler has written that although many early scientists took Lamarckism seriously, it was discredited by genetics in the early twentieth century.<ref>{{harvnb|Bowler|2013|p=21}}</ref>

Joseph Springer and Dennis Holley commented in 2013 that:<ref name="SpringerHolley2013"/>

<blockquote>Lamarck and his ideas were ridiculed and discredited. In a strange twist of fate, Lamarck may have the last laugh. Epigenetics, an emerging field of genetics, has shown that Lamarck may have been at least partially correct all along. It seems that reversible and heritable changes can occur without a change in DNA sequence (genotype) and that such changes may be induced spontaneously or in response to environmental factors—Lamarck's "acquired traits." Determining which observed phenotypes are genetically inherited and which are environmentally induced remains an important and ongoing part of the study of genetics, developmental biology, and medicine.<ref name="SpringerHolley2013">{{harvnb|Springer|Holley|2013|p=94}}</ref></blockquote>

The evolutionary biologist [[T. Ryan Gregory]] contends that epigenetic inheritance should not be considered Lamarckian. According to Gregory, Lamarck did not claim that the environment directly affected living things. Instead, Lamarck "argued that the environment created needs to which organisms responded by using some features more and others less, that this resulted in those features being accentuated or attenuated, and that this difference was then inherited by offspring." Gregory has stated that Lamarckian evolution in epigenetics is more like Darwin's point of view than Lamarck's.<ref name="Ryan 2009"/>

In 2007, [[David Haig (biologist)|David Haig]] wrote that research into epigenetic processes does allow a Lamarckian element in evolution but the processes do not challenge the main tenets of the modern evolutionary synthesis as modern Lamarckians have claimed. Haig argued for the primacy of DNA and evolution of epigenetic switches by natural selection.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Haig |first=David |s2cid=16322990 |author-link=David Haig (biologist) |date=June 2007 |title=Weismann Rules!

Recurrent, predictable changes of epigenetic state provide a useful set of switches that allow genetically-identical cells to acquire differentiated functions and allow facultative responses of a genotype to environmental changes (provided that 'similar' changes have occurred repeatedly in the past). However, most neo-Darwinists would claim that the ability to adaptively switch epigenetic state is a property of the DNA sequence (in the sense that alternative sequences would show different switching behavior) and that any increase of adaptedness in the system has come about by a process of natural selection.}}</ref> Haig has written that there is a "visceral attraction" to Lamarckian evolution from the public and some scientists, as it posits the world with a meaning, in which organisms can shape their own evolutionary destiny.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Haig |first=David |date=November 2011 |title=Lamarck Ascending! |journal= Philosophy and Theory in Biology|type=Book essay |volume=3 |issue=e204 |doi=10.3998/ptb.6959004.0003.004|doi-access=free }} "A Review of ''Transformations of Lamarckism: From Subtle Fluids to Molecular Biology'', edited by Snait B.

===Somatic hypermutation and reverse transcription to germline===

In the 1970s, the Australian immunologist [[Edward J. Steele]] developed a neo-Lamarckian theory of [[somatic hypermutation]] within the immune system and coupled it to the [[reverse transcription]] of RNA derived from body cells to the DNA of [[germline]] cells. This reverse transcription process supposedly enabled characteristics or bodily changes acquired during a lifetime to be written back into the DNA and passed on to subsequent generations.<ref name="Steele2016">{{cite journal |last=Steele |first=E.

The mechanism was meant to explain why homologous [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequences]] from the [[V(D)J recombination|VDJ gene]] regions of parent mice were found in their germ cells and seemed to persist in the offspring for a few generations. The mechanism involved the somatic selection and clonal amplification of newly acquired [[antibody]] [[gene]] sequences generated via somatic hypermutation in [[B-cell]]s. The [[messenger RNA]] products of these somatically novel genes were captured by [[retrovirus]]es [[endogenous]] to the B-cells and were then transported through the bloodstream where they could breach the Weismann or soma-germ barrier and reverse transcribe the newly acquired genes into the cells of the germ line, in the manner of Darwin's pangenes.<ref name="Steele1981">{{Cite book |title=Somatic selection and adaptive evolution: on the inheritance of acquired characters |last=Steele |first=E.

===Hologenome theory of evolution===
{{further|hologenome theory of evolution}}

The [[hologenome theory of evolution]], while Darwinian, has Lamarckian aspects. An individual animal or plant lives in [[symbiosis]] with many [[microorganism]]s, and together they have a "hologenome" consisting of all their genomes. The hologenome can vary like any other genome by [[mutation]], [[sexual recombination]], and [[chromosome rearrangement]], but in addition it can vary when populations of microorganisms increase or decrease (resembling Lamarckian use and disuse), and when it gains new kinds of microorganism (resembling Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics). These changes are then passed on to offspring.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Eugene |author-link1=Eugene Rosenberg |last2=Sharon |first2=Gill |last3=Zilber-Rosenberg |first3=Ilana |date=December 2009 |title=The hologenome theory of evolution contains Lamarckian aspects within a Darwinian framework |journal=Environmental Microbiology |volume=11 |issue=12 |pages=2959–2962 |doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.01995.x |pmid=19573132|bibcode=2009EnvMi..11.2959R }}</ref> The mechanism is largely uncontroversial, and natural selection does sometimes occur at whole system (hologenome) level, but it is not clear that this is always the case.<ref name="Moran Sloan 2015">{{cite journal |last1=Moran |first1=Nancy A. |author-link=Nancy A.

===Baldwin effect===
{{further|Baldwin effect}}
The Baldwin effect, named after the psychologist [[James Mark Baldwin]] by George Gaylord Simpson in 1953, proposes that the ability to learn new behaviours can improve an animal's reproductive success, and hence the course of natural selection on its genetic makeup. Simpson stated that the mechanism was "not inconsistent with the modern synthesis" of evolutionary theory,<ref name="depew03">Depew, David J. (2003), "Baldwin Boosters, Baldwin Skeptics" in: {{cite book |title=Evolution and learning: The Baldwin effect reconsidered |last1=Weber |first1=Bruce H. |first2=David J. |last2=Depew |year=2003 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-23229-6 |pages=3–31 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yBtRzBilw1MC&q=baldwin+effect&pg=PR9 }}</ref> though he doubted that it occurred very often or could be proven to occur. He noted that the Baldwin effect provided a reconciliation between the neo-Darwinian and neo-Lamarckian approaches, something that the modern synthesis had seemed to render unnecessary. In particular, the effect allows animals to adapt to a new stress in the environment through behavioural changes, followed by genetic change. This somewhat resembles Lamarckism but without requiring animals to inherit characteristics acquired by their parents.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Baldwin effect |author-link=George Gaylord Simpson |author=Simpson, George Gaylord |year=1953 |journal=Evolution |volume=7 | issue=2 |pages=110–117 |doi=10.2307/2405746|jstor=2405746 }}</ref> The Baldwin effect is broadly accepted by Darwinists.<ref name="dennett03">[[Daniel Dennett|Dennett, Daniel]] (2003), "The Baldwin Effect, a Crane, not a Skyhook" in: {{cite book |title=Evolution and learning: The Baldwin effect reconsidered |last1=Weber |first1=Bruce H. |first2=David J. |last2=Depew |year=2003 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-23229-6 |pages=69–106 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yBtRzBilw1MC&q=baldwin+effect&pg=PR9}}</ref>
