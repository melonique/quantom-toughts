In [[quantum mechanics]], '''Schrödinger's cat''' is a [[thought experiment]], sometimes described as a [[paradox]], of [[quantum superposition]]. In the thought experiment, a hypothetical [[cat]] may be considered simultaneously both alive and dead, while it is unobserved in a closed box, as a result of its fate being linked to a random [[Subatomic particle|subatomic]] event that may or may not occur. This thought experiment was devised by physicist [[Erwin Schrödinger]] in 1935<ref name="Schrodinger1935">{{cite journal | author-link = Erwin Schrödinger | first = Erwin| last=Schrödinger | title = Die gegenwärtige Situation in der Quantenmechanik (The Present Situation in Quantum Mechanics) | journal = [[Naturwissenschaften]] | doi = 10.1007/BF01491891 | volume = 23 | issue = 48 | pages = 807–812 | quote = Man kann auch ganz burleske Fälle konstruieren.

In Schrödinger's original formulation, a cat, a flask of poison, and a [[radioactive]] source are placed in a sealed box. If an internal radiation monitor (e.g. a [[Geiger counter]]) detects radioactivity (i.e. a single atom decaying), the flask is shattered, releasing the poison, which kills the cat. The Copenhagen interpretation implies that, after a while, the cat is ''simultaneously'' alive ''and'' dead. Yet, when one looks in the box, one sees the cat ''either'' alive ''or'' dead, not both alive ''and'' dead. This poses the question of when exactly [[quantum superposition]] ends and reality resolves into one possibility or the other.

Although originally a critique on the Copenhagen interpretation, Schrödinger's seemingly paradoxical thought experiment became part of the foundation of quantum mechanics. The scenario is often featured in theoretical discussions of the [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]], particularly in situations involving the [[measurement problem]]. As a result, Schrödinger's cat has had enduring [[Schrödinger's cat in popular culture|appeal in popular culture]]. The experiment is not intended to be actually performed on a cat, but rather as an easily understandable illustration of the behavior of atoms. Experiments at the atomic scale have been carried out, showing that very small objects may exist as superpositions; but superposing an object as large as a cat would pose considerable technical difficulties.{{citation needed|date=September 2023}}

Fundamentally, the Schrödinger's cat experiment asks how long quantum superpositions last and when (or ''whether'') they collapse. Different [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretations of the mathematics of quantum mechanics]] have been proposed that give different explanations for this process, but Schrödinger's cat remains an [[List of unsolved problems in physics|unsolved problem in physics]].

{{unsolved|physics|How does the quantum description of reality, which includes elements such as the superposition of states and wavefunction collapse or quantum decoherence, give rise to the reality we perceive?

Schrödinger intended his thought experiment as a discussion of the [[EPR paradox|EPR article]]—named after its authors [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], [[Boris Podolsky|Podolsky]], and [[Nathan Rosen|Rosen]]—in 1935.<ref>[http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v47/i10/p777_1 Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208145129/http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v47/i10/p777_1 |date=2006-02-08 }} A.

The prevailing theory, called the [[Copenhagen interpretation]], says that a quantum system remains in superposition until it interacts with, or is observed by, the external world. When this happens, the superposition [[wave function collapse|collapses]] into one or another of the possible definite states. The EPR experiment shows that a system with multiple particles separated by large distances can be in such a superposition. Schrödinger and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] exchanged letters about [[EPR paradox|Einstein's EPR article]], in the course of which Einstein pointed out that the  state of an [[Instability|unstable]] keg of [[gunpowder]] will, after a while, contain a superposition of both exploded and unexploded states.<ref name="Stanford1" />

To further illustrate, Schrödinger described how one could, in principle, create a superposition in a large-scale system by making it dependent on a quantum particle that was in a superposition.  He proposed a scenario with a cat in a closed steel chamber, wherein the cat's life or death depended on the state of a [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] atom, whether it had decayed and emitted radiation or not. According to Schrödinger, the Copenhagen interpretation implies that ''the cat remains both alive and dead'' until the state has been observed. Schrödinger did not wish to promote the idea of dead-and-live cats as a serious possibility; on the contrary, he intended the example to illustrate the absurdity of the existing view of quantum mechanics,<ref name="Schrodinger1935" /> and thus he was employing [[reductio ad absurdum]].

Since Schrödinger's time, various [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretations of the mathematics of quantum mechanics]] have been advanced by physicists, some of which regard the "alive and dead" cat superposition as quite real, others do not.<ref name="Polkinghorne">{{cite book | last1       = Polkinghorne | first1      = J.

Schrödinger wrote:<ref name="Schrodinger1935" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Trimmer|first1=John D.|title=The Present Situation in Quantum Mechanics: A Translation of Schrödinger's "Cat Paradox" Paper|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|date=1980|volume=124|issue=5|pages=323–338|jstor=986572}} The English translation here is based on the German original, not on the inaccurate version in this source's translation of the entire article:

{{Blockquote|
One can contrive even completely burlesque [farcical] cases. A cat is put in a steel chamber along with the following infernal device (which must be secured against direct interference by the cat): in a [[Geiger counter]], there is a tiny amount of radioactive substance, so tiny that in the course of an hour one of the atoms will perhaps decay, but also, with equal probability, that none of them will; if it does happen, the counter tube will discharge and through a relay release a hammer that will shatter a small flask of [[hydrocyanic acid]]. If one has left this entire system to itself for an hour, one would tell oneself that the cat is still alive if no atom has [[radioactive decay|decayed]] in the meantime. Even a single atomic decay would have poisoned it. The [[wave function|psi-function]] of the entire system would express this by having in it the living and dead cat (pardon the expression) mixed or spread out in equal parts.

It is typical of these cases that an indeterminacy originally restricted to the atomic domain turns into a sensually observable [macroscopic] indeterminacy, which can then be resolved by direct observation. This prevents us from so naïvely accepting a "blurred model" as representative of reality. Per se, it would not embody anything unclear or contradictory. There is a difference between a shaky or out-of-focus photograph and a snapshot of clouds and fog banks.}}

Schrödinger's famous [[thought experiment]] poses the question, "''when'' does a quantum system stop existing as a superposition of states and become one or the other?"  (More technically, when does the actual quantum state stop being a non-trivial [[linear combination]] of states, each of which resembles different classical states, and instead begin to have a unique classical description?) If the cat survives, it remembers only being alive. But explanations of the EPR experiments that are consistent with standard microscopic quantum mechanics require that macroscopic objects, such as cats and notebooks, do not always have unique classical descriptions. The thought experiment illustrates this apparent paradox. Our intuition says that no observer can be in more than one state simultaneously—yet the cat, it seems from the thought experiment, can be in such a condition. Is the cat required to be an observer, or does its existence in a single well-defined classical state require another external observer? Each alternative seemed absurd to Einstein, who was impressed by the ability of the thought experiment to highlight these issues. In a letter to Schrödinger dated 1950, he wrote:
{{Blockquote|You are the only contemporary physicist, besides [[Max von Laue|Laue]], who sees that one cannot get around the assumption of reality, if only one is honest. Most of them simply do not see what sort of risky game they are playing with reality—reality as something independent of what is experimentally established. Their interpretation is, however, refuted most elegantly by your system of radioactive atom + amplifier + charge of gun powder + cat in a box, in which the psi-function of the system contains both the cat alive and blown to bits. Nobody really doubts that the presence or absence of the cat is something independent of the act of observation.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Induction and Scientific Realism: Einstein versus van Fraassen Part Three: Einstein, Aim-Oriented Empiricism and the Discovery of Special and General Relativity|first=Nicholas|last=Maxwell|date=1 January 1993|volume=44|issue=2|pages=275–305|doi=10.1093/bjps/44.2.275|jstor=687649|journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science}}</ref>}}
Note that the charge of gunpowder is not mentioned in Schrödinger's setup, which uses a Geiger counter as an amplifier and hydrocyanic poison instead of gunpowder. The gunpowder had been mentioned in Einstein's original suggestion to Schrödinger 15 years before, and Einstein carried it forward to the present discussion.<ref name="Stanford1" />

== Interpretations ==
Since Schrödinger's time, other interpretations of quantum mechanics have been proposed that give different answers to the questions posed by Schrödinger's cat of how long superpositions last and when (or ''whether'') they collapse.

=== Copenhagen interpretation ===
{{Main|Copenhagen interpretation}}

A commonly held interpretation of quantum mechanics is the Copenhagen interpretation.<ref name="Wimmel1992">{{cite book|first=Hermann|last=Wimmel|title=Quantum physics & observed reality: a critical interpretation of quantum mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-4sJ_fgyZJEC&pg=PA2|access-date=9 May 2011|year=1992|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-02-1010-6|page=2|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520185205/http://books.google.com/books?id=-4sJ_fgyZJEC&pg=PA2|archive-date=20 May 2013}}</ref>  In the Copenhagen interpretation, a system stops being a superposition of states and becomes either one or the other when an observation takes place. This thought experiment makes apparent the fact that the nature of [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|measurement]], or observation, is not well-defined in this interpretation. The experiment can be interpreted to mean that while the box is closed, the system simultaneously exists in a superposition of the states "decayed nucleus/dead cat" and "undecayed nucleus/living cat" and that only when the box is opened and an observation performed does the [[wave function]] collapse into one of the two states.

===Von Neumann interpretation===
{{Main|Von Neumann–Wigner interpretation}}
In 1932, [[John von Neumann]] described in his book ''[[Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics|Mathematical Foundations]]'' a pattern where the radioactive source is observed by a device, which itself is observed by another device and so on. It makes no difference in the predictions of quantum theory where along this chain of causal effects the superposition collapses.<ref name="Tales of the Quantum">{{cite book |last1=Hobson |first1=Art |title=Tales of the Quantum: Understanding Physics' Most Fundamental Theory |date=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=9780190679637 |pages=200–202 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mGduDQAAQBAJ |access-date=April 8, 2022}}</ref> This potentially infinite chain could be broken if the last device is replaced by a conscious observer. This solved the problem because it was claimed that an individual's consciousness cannot be multiple.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Omnès |first1=Roland |title=Understanding Quantum Mechanics |date=1999 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, New Jersey |isbn=0-691-00435-8 |pages=60–62 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XET_DwAAQBAJ |access-date=April 8, 2022}}</ref> Neumann asserted that a conscious observer is necessary for collapse to one or the other (e.g., either a live cat or a dead cat) of the terms on the right-hand side of a [[wave function]]. This interpretation was later adopted by [[Eugene Wigner]], who then rejected the interpretation in a thought experiment known as [[Wigner's friend]].<ref name="Surfing the Quantum World">{{cite book |last1=Levin |first1=Frank S. |title=Surfing the Quantum World |date=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-19-880827-5 |pages=229–232 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y1w-DwAAQBAJ |access-date=April 8, 2022}}</ref>

Wigner supposed that a friend opened the box and observed the cat without telling anyone. From Wigner's conscious perspective, the friend is now part of the wave function and has seen a live cat and seen a dead cat. To a third person's conscious perspective, Wigner himself becomes part of the wave function once Wigner learns the outcome from the friend. This could be extended indefinitely.<ref name="Surfing the Quantum World"/>

===Bohr's interpretation===
One of the main scientists associated with the Copenhagen interpretation, [[Niels Bohr]], offered an interpretation that is independent of a subjective observer-induced collapse of the wave function, or of measurement; instead, an "irreversible" or effectively irreversible process causes the decay of quantum coherence, which imparts the classical behavior of "observation" or "measurement".<ref>{{cite journal |title=Against 'measurement' |author=[[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] |journal=Physics World |volume=3 |number=8 |year=1990 |pages=33–41 |doi=10.1088/2058-7058/3/8/26}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=[[Niels Bohr]] |orig-date=May 16, 1947 |date=1985 |series=Niels Bohr: Collected Works |volume=6 |title=Foundations of Quantum Physics I (1926-1932) |editor=Jørgen Kalckar |pages=451–454 |url=https://www.nbarchive.dk/publications/bcw/}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |chapter=To fathom space and time |pages=121 |author=Stig Stenholm | title=Quantum Optics, Experimental Gravitation, and Measurement Theory|editor1-link=Pierre Meystre |editor=Pierre Meystre |publisher=Plenum Press |year=1983 |quote=The role of irreversibility in the theory of measurement has been emphasized by many.

A resolution of the paradox is that the triggering of the Geiger counter counts as a measurement of the state of the radioactive substance. Because a measurement has already occurred deciding the state of the cat, the subsequent observation by a human records only what has already occurred.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Puri |first1=Ravinder R. |title=Non-Relativistic Quantum Mechanics |date=2017 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, United Kingdom |isbn=978-1-107-16436-9 |page=146 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qDbSDgAAQBAJ |access-date=April 8, 2022}}</ref> Analysis of an actual experiment by [[Roger Carpenter]] and A.

=== Many-worlds interpretation and consistent histories ===
{{Main|Many-worlds interpretation}}
[[File:Schroedingers cat film.svg|thumb|The quantum-mechanical "Schrödinger's cat" paradox according to the many-worlds interpretation. In this interpretation, every event is a branch point. The cat is both alive and dead—regardless of whether the box is opened—but the "alive" and "dead" cats are in different branches of the universe that are equally real but cannot interact with each other.]]

In 1957, [[Hugh Everett]] formulated the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, which does not single out observation as a special process. In the many-worlds interpretation, both alive and dead states of the cat persist after the box is opened, but are [[quantum decoherence|decoherent]] from each other. In other words, when the box is opened, the observer and the possibly-dead cat split into an observer looking at a box with a dead cat and an observer looking at a box with a live cat. But since the dead and alive states are decoherent, there is no effective communication or interaction between them.

When opening the box, the observer becomes entangled with the cat, so "observer states" corresponding to the cat's being alive and dead are formed; each observer state is [[quantum entanglement|entangled]], or linked, with the cat so that the observation of the cat's state and the cat's state correspond with each other.  Quantum decoherence ensures that the different outcomes have no interaction with each other. The same mechanism of quantum decoherence is also important for the interpretation in terms of [[consistent histories]]. Only the "dead cat" or the "live cat" can be a part of a consistent history in this interpretation. Decoherence is generally considered to prevent simultaneous observation of multiple states.<ref name="zurek03">{{cite journal | last1 = Zurek | first1 = Wojciech H. | author-link = Wojciech H.

Zurek]], "Decoherence and the transition from quantum to classical", ''Physics Today'', 44, pp. 36–44 (1991)</ref>

A variant of the Schrödinger's cat experiment, known as the [[Quantum suicide and immortality|quantum suicide]] machine, has been proposed by cosmologist [[Max Tegmark]]. It examines the Schrödinger's cat experiment from the point of view of the cat, and argues that by using this approach, one may be able to distinguish between the Copenhagen interpretation and many-worlds.

=== Ensemble interpretation ===

The [[Ensemble Interpretation|ensemble interpretation]] states that superpositions are nothing but subensembles of a larger statistical ensemble. The state vector would not apply to individual cat experiments, but only to the statistics of many similarly prepared cat experiments. Proponents of this interpretation state that this makes the Schrödinger's cat paradox a trivial matter, or a non-issue.

This interpretation serves to ''discard'' the idea that a single physical system in quantum mechanics has a mathematical description that corresponds to it in any way.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smolin|first=Lee|date=October 2012|title=A real ensemble interpretation of quantum mechanics|journal=Foundations of Physics|volume=42|issue=10|pages=1239–1261|doi=10.1007/s10701-012-9666-4|issn=0015-9018|arxiv=1104.2822|bibcode=2012FoPh...42.1239S|s2cid=118505566}}</ref>

=== Relational interpretation ===
{{main|Relational quantum mechanics}}
The [[Relational quantum mechanics|relational interpretation]] makes no fundamental distinction between the human experimenter, the cat, and the apparatus or between animate and inanimate systems; all are quantum systems governed by the same rules of wavefunction [[Time evolution|evolution]], and all may be considered "observers". But the relational interpretation allows that different observers can give different accounts of the same series of events, depending on the information they have about the system.<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Rovelli|first = Carlo|author-link = Carlo Rovelli|title = Relational Quantum Mechanics|journal = International Journal of Theoretical Physics|volume = 35|pages = 1637–1678|year = 1996|arxiv = quant-ph/9609002 |doi = 10.1007/BF02302261|bibcode = 1996IJTP...35.1637R|issue = 8 |s2cid = 16325959}}</ref> The cat can be considered an observer of the apparatus; meanwhile, the experimenter can be considered another observer of the system in the box (the cat plus the apparatus). Before the box is opened, the cat, by nature of its being alive or dead, has information about the state of the apparatus (the atom has either decayed or not decayed); but the experimenter does not have information about the state of the box contents. In this way, the two observers simultaneously have different accounts of the situation: To the cat, the wavefunction of the apparatus has appeared to "collapse"; to the experimenter, the contents of the box appear to be in superposition. Not until the box is opened, and both observers have the same information about what happened, do both system states appear to "collapse" into the same definite result, a cat that is either alive or dead.

=== Transactional interpretation ===

In the [[transactional interpretation]] the apparatus emits an advanced wave backward in time, which combined with the wave that the source emits forward in time, forms a standing wave. The waves are seen as physically real, and the apparatus is considered an "observer". In the transactional interpretation, the collapse of the wavefunction is "atemporal" and occurs along the whole transaction between the source and the apparatus.  The cat is never in superposition.  Rather the cat is only in one state at any particular time, regardless of when the human experimenter looks in the box. The transactional interpretation resolves this quantum paradox.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cramer|first=John G.|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280926546|title=The transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics|publisher=Reviews of Modern Physics|date=July 1986|volume=58|pages=647–685}}</ref>

=== Zeno effects ===

The [[Quantum Zeno effect|Zeno effect]] is known to cause delays to any changes from the initial state.

On the other hand, the anti-Zeno effect accelerates the changes. For example, if you peek a look into the cat box frequently you may either cause delays to the fateful choice or, conversely, accelerate it.  Both the Zeno effect and the anti-Zeno effect are real and known to happen to real atoms. The quantum system being measured must be strongly coupled to the surrounding environment (in this case to the apparatus, the experiment room ... etc.) in order to obtain more accurate information. But while there is no information passed to the outside world, it is considered to be a ''quasi-measurement'', but as soon as the information about the cat's well-being is passed on to the outside world (by peeking into the box) quasi-measurement turns into measurement.

=== Objective collapse theories ===

According to [[objective-collapse theory|objective collapse theories]], superpositions are destroyed spontaneously (irrespective of external observation) when some objective physical threshold (of time, mass, temperature, [[irreversibility]], etc.) is reached. Thus, the cat would be expected to have settled into a definite state long before the box is opened. This could loosely be phrased as "the cat observes itself" or "the environment observes the cat".

Objective collapse theories require a modification of standard quantum mechanics to allow superpositions to be destroyed by the process of time evolution.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Okon|first1=Elias|last2=Sudarsky|first2=Daniel|date=2014-02-01|title=Benefits of Objective Collapse Models for Cosmology and Quantum Gravity|journal=Foundations of Physics|language=en|volume=44|issue=2|pages=114–143|doi=10.1007/s10701-014-9772-6|issn=1572-9516|arxiv=1309.1730|bibcode=2014FoPh...44..114O|s2cid=67831520}}</ref> These theories could ideally be tested by creating mesoscopic superposition states in the experiment.

The experiment as described is a purely theoretical one, and the machine proposed is not known to have been constructed. However, successful experiments involving similar principles, e.g. superpositions of [[mesoscopic|relatively large]] (by the standards of quantum physics) objects have been performed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/3309/what-is-the-worlds-biggest-schrodinger-cat|title=What is the world's biggest Schrodinger cat?|website=stackexchange.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108000629/http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/3309/what-is-the-worlds-biggest-schrodinger-cat|archive-date=2012-01-08}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=December 2022|reason=StackExchange is a web forum}} These experiments do not show that a cat-sized object can be superposed, but the known upper limit on "[[cat state]]s" has been pushed upwards by them. In many cases the state is short-lived, even when cooled to near [[absolute zero]].

In [[quantum computing]] the phrase "cat state" sometimes refers to the [[Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger state|GHZ state]], wherein several qubits are in an equal superposition of all being 0 and all being 1; e.g.,

:<math> | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \bigg( | 00\ldots0 \rangle + |11\ldots1 \rangle \bigg). </math>

According to at least one proposal, it may be possible to determine the state of the cat ''before'' observing it.<ref name="LS-20191107">{{cite news |last=Najjar |first=Dana |title=Physicists Can Finally Peek at Schrödinger's Cat Without Killing It Forever |url=https://www.livescience.com/schrodingers-cat-can-be-peeked-at.html |date=7 November 2019 |work=[[Live Science]] |access-date=7 November 2019 }}</ref><ref name="NJP-20191001">{{cite journal |last1=Patekar |first1=Kartik |last2=Hofmann |first2=Holger F. |title=The role of system–meter entanglement in controlling the resolution and decoherence of quantum measurements |journal=[[New Journal of Physics]] |volume=21 |issue=10 |pages=103006 |doi=10.1088/1367-2630/ab4451|arxiv=1905.09978  |year=2019 |bibcode=2019NJPh...21j3006P |doi-access=free }}</ref>
