'''Magnetic resonance imaging''' ('''MRI''') is a [[medical imaging]] technique used in [[radiology]] to form pictures of the [[anatomy]] and the [[physiological]] processes inside the body. [[Physics of magnetic resonance imaging#MRI scanner|MRI scanners]] use strong [[magnetic field]]s, magnetic field gradients, and [[radio wave]]s to generate images of the organs in the body. MRI does not involve [[X-rays]] or the use of [[ionizing radiation]], which distinguishes it from [[CT scan|computed tomography]] (CT) and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) scans. MRI is a [[nuclear magnetic resonance#Medicine|medical application]] of [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) which can also be used for imaging in other [[nuclear magnetic resonance#Applications|NMR applications]], such as [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectroscopy]].<ref name="Rinck">

MRI is widely used in hospitals and clinics for [[medical diagnosis]], [[cancer staging|staging]] and follow-up of disease. Compared to CT, MRI provides better contrast in images of soft tissues, e.g. in the [[magnetic resonance imaging of the brain|brain]] or abdomen. However, it may be perceived as less comfortable by patients, due to the usually longer and louder measurements with the subject in a long, confining tube, although "open" MRI designs mostly relieve this. Additionally, [[Implant (medicine)|implants]] and other non-removable metal in the body can pose a risk and may exclude some patients from undergoing an MRI examination safely.

MRI was originally called NMRI (nuclear magnetic resonance imaging), but "nuclear" was dropped to avoid [[Radiophobia|negative associations]].<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=McRobbie DW, Moore EA, Graves MJ, Prince MR |date=2007 |title=MRI from Picture to Proton |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=1 |isbn=978-1-139-45719-4}}</ref> Certain [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] are able to absorb [[radio frequency]] (RF) energy when placed in an external [[magnetic field]]; the resultant evolving [[spin polarization]] can induce a [[radio frequency|RF]] signal in a radio frequency coil and thereby be detected.<ref name=hoult>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Hoult DI, Bahkar B |title=NMR Signal Reception: Virtual Photons and Coherent Spontaneous Emission |journal=Concepts in Magnetic Resonance |year=1998 |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=277–297 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-0534(1997)9:5<277::AID-CMR1>3.0.CO;2-W}}</ref> In clinical and research MRI, [[hydrogen|hydrogen atoms]] are most often used to generate a macroscopic polarization that is detected by antennas close to the subject being examined.<ref name=hoult /> Hydrogen atoms are [[Composition of the human body|naturally abundant in humans]] and other biological organisms, particularly in [[properties of water|water]] and [[Lipid|fat]]. For this reason, most MRI scans essentially map the location of water and fat in the body. Pulses of radio waves excite the [[Spin (physics)|nuclear spin]] energy transition, and magnetic field gradients localize the polarization in space. By varying the parameters of the [[pulse sequence]], different contrasts may be generated between tissues based on the [[relaxation (NMR)|relaxation]] properties of the hydrogen atoms therein.

Since its development in the 1970s and 1980s, MRI has proven to be a versatile imaging technique. While MRI is most prominently used in [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic medicine]] and biomedical research, it also may be used to form images of non-living objects, such as [[Mummy|mummies]]. [[Diffusion MRI]] and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional MRI]] extend the utility of MRI to capture neuronal tracts and blood flow respectively in the nervous system, in addition to detailed spatial images. The sustained increase in demand for MRI within [[health system]]s has led to concerns about [[cost-effectiveness analysis|cost effectiveness]] and [[overdiagnosis]].<ref name="Smith-Bindman2012">{{irrelevant citation|date=November 2021|reason=source does not explicitly address these points.}}{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith-Bindman R, [[Diana Miglioretti|Miglioretti DL]], Johnson E, Lee C, Feigelson HS, Flynn M, Greenlee RT, Kruger RL, Hornbrook MC, Roblin D, Solberg LI, Vanneman N, Weinmann S, Williams AE | display-authors = 6 | title = Use of diagnostic imaging studies and associated radiation exposure for patients enrolled in large integrated health care systems, 1996-2010 | journal = JAMA | volume = 307 | issue = 22 | pages = 2400–9 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22692172 | pmc = 3859870 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2012.5960 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |date=2009 |title=Health at a glance 2009 OECD indicators |doi=10.1787/health_glance-2009-en |isbn=978-92-64-07555-9}}</ref>{{Dubious|date=November 2021}}

In most medical applications, [[hydrogen]] nuclei, which consist solely of a [[proton]], that are in tissues create a signal that is processed to form an image of the body in terms of the density of those nuclei in a specific region. Given that the protons are affected by fields from other atoms to which they are bonded, it is possible to separate responses from hydrogen in specific compounds. To perform a study, the person is positioned within an [[Physics of magnetic resonance imaging#MRI scanner|MRI scanner]] that forms a strong [[magnetic field]] around the area to be imaged. First, energy from an [[oscillation|oscillating]] magnetic field is temporarily applied to the patient at the appropriate [[resonance]] frequency. Scanning with X and Y gradient coils causes a selected region of the patient to experience the exact magnetic field required for the energy to be absorbed. The atoms are [[Excited state|excited]] by a [[Radio frequency|RF]] pulse and the resultant signal is measured by a [[Radiofrequency coil|receiving coil]]. The RF signal may be processed to deduce position information by looking at the changes in RF level and phase caused by varying the local magnetic field using [[Physics of magnetic resonance imaging#Gradients|gradient coils]]. As these coils are rapidly switched during the excitation and response to perform a moving line scan, they create the characteristic repetitive noise of an MRI scan as the windings move slightly due to [[magnetostriction]]. The contrast between different tissues is determined by the rate at which excited atoms return to the [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium state]]. [[Exogeny|Exogenous]] [[contrast agent]]s may be given to the person to make the image clearer.<ref name ="McRobbie">{{cite book | vauthors = McRobbie DW | title=MRI from picture to proton | date=2007 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge, UK; New York | isbn=978-0-521-68384-5}}</ref>

The major components of an MRI scanner are the main [[magnet]], which polarizes the sample, the [[Shim (magnetism)|shim coils]] for correcting shifts in the [[homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]] of the main magnetic field, the gradient system which is used to localize the region to be scanned and the RF system, which excites the sample and detects the resulting NMR signal. The whole system is controlled by one or more computers.

MRI requires a magnetic field that is both strong and [[Homogeneity (physics)|uniform]] to a few parts per million across the scan volume. The field strength of the magnet is measured in [[tesla (unit)|teslas]] – and while the majority of systems operate at 1.5 T, commercial systems are available between 0.2 and 7 T.

Each tissue returns to its equilibrium state after excitation by the independent relaxation processes of T<sub>1</sub> ([[Spin–lattice relaxation|spin-lattice]]; that is, magnetization in the same direction as the static magnetic field) and T<sub>2</sub> ([[Spin-spin relaxation time|spin-spin]]; transverse to the static magnetic field).
To create a T<sub>1</sub>-weighted image, magnetization is allowed to recover before measuring the MR signal by changing the [[repetition time]] (TR). This image weighting is useful for assessing the cerebral cortex, identifying fatty tissue, characterizing focal liver lesions, and in general, obtaining morphological information, as well as for [[MRI contrast agent|post-contrast]] imaging.
{{anchor|T2-weighted_MRI}}
To create a T<sub>2</sub>-weighted image, magnetization is allowed to decay before measuring the MR signal by changing the [[echo time]] (TE). This image weighting is useful for detecting [[edema]] and inflammation, revealing [[Hyperintensity|white matter lesions]], and assessing zonal anatomy in the [[prostate]] and [[uterus]].

The information from MRI scans comes in the form of [[Contrast resolution|image contrasts]] based on differences in the rate of relaxation of [[spin quantum number|nuclear spins]] following their perturbation by an oscillating magnetic field (in the form of radiofrequency pulses through the sample).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=De Leon-Rodriguez |first1=L.M. |title=Basic MR Relaxation Mechanisms and Contrast Agent Design |journal=Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging |date=2015 |volume=42 |issue=3|pages=545–565 |doi=10.1002/jmri.24787 |pmid=25975847 |pmc=4537356 }}</ref> The relaxation rates are a measure of the time it takes for a signal to decay back to an equilibrium state from either the longitudinal or transverse plane.

[[Magnetization]] builds up along the z-axis in the presence of a magnetic field, B<sub>0</sub>, such that  the [[Magnetic dipole|magnetic dipoles]] in the sample will, on average, align with the z-axis summing to a total magnetization M<sub>z</sub>. This magnetization along z is defined as the equilibrium magnetization; magnetization is defined as the sum of all magnetic dipoles in a sample. Following the equilibrium magnetization, a 90° radiofrequency (RF) pulse flips the direction of the magnetization vector in the xy-plane, and is then switched off. The initial magnetic field  B<sub>0</sub>, however, is still applied. Thus, the spin magnetization vector will slowly return from the xy-plane back to the equilibrium state. The time it takes for the magnetization vector to return to its equilibrium value, M<sub>z</sub>, is referred to as the longitudinal relaxation time, T<sub>1</sub>.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://imserc.northwestern.edu/downloads/nmr-t1.pdf}}</ref> Subsequently, the rate at which this happens is simply the reciprocal of the relaxation time: <math>\frac {1} {T1} = R1</math>. Similarly, the time in which it takes for M<sub>xy</sub> to return to zero is T<sub>2</sub>, with the rate <math>\frac {1} {T2} = R2</math>.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McHale |first1=J. |title=Molecular Spectroscopy |date=2017 |publisher=CRC Press/Taylor and Francis Group |page=73-80}}</ref>  Magnetization as a function of time is defined by the [[Bloch equations]].

[[File:Spin Orientations During Relaxation.jpg|thumb|Diagram of changing magnetization and spin orientations throughout spin-lattice relaxation experiment]]

T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> values are dependent on the chemical environment of the sample; hence their utility in MRI. Soft tissue and muscle tissue relax at different rates, yielding the image contrast in a typical scan.

==== Liver and gastrointestinal ====
[[Hepatobiliary system|Hepatobiliary]] MR is used to detect and characterize lesions of the [[liver]], [[pancreas]], and [[bile duct]]s.

Extracellular contrast agents are used widely in liver MRI, and newer hepatobiliary contrast agents also provide the opportunity to perform functional biliary imaging. Anatomical imaging of the bile ducts is achieved by using a heavily T2-weighted sequence in magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). Functional imaging of the pancreas is performed following administration of [[secretin]]. MR enterography provides non-invasive assessment of inflammatory bowel disease and small bowel tumors.

==== Angiography ====
[[File:mra1.jpg|thumb|Magnetic resonance angiography]]
{{Main|Magnetic resonance angiography}}

Magnetic resonance [[angiography]] (MRA) generates pictures of the arteries to evaluate them for [[stenosis]] (abnormal narrowing) or [[aneurysm]]s (vessel wall dilatations, at risk of rupture). MRA is often used to evaluate the arteries of the neck and brain, the thoracic and abdominal aorta, the renal arteries, and the legs (called a "run-off"). A variety of techniques can be used to generate the pictures, such as administration of a [[paramagnetic]] contrast agent ([[gadolinium]]) or using a technique known as "flow-related enhancement" (e.g., 2D and 3D time-of-flight sequences), where most of the signal on an image is due to blood that recently moved into that plane (see also [[FLASH MRI]]).<ref name="Wheaton Miyazaki pp. 286–304">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wheaton AJ, Miyazaki M | title = Non-contrast enhanced MR angiography: physical principles | journal = Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 286–304 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22807222 | doi = 10.1002/jmri.23641 | publisher = Wiley | s2cid = 24048799 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Techniques involving phase accumulation (known as phase contrast angiography) can also be used to generate flow velocity maps easily and accurately. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) is a similar procedure that is used to image veins. In this method, the tissue is now excited inferiorly, while the signal is gathered in the plane immediately superior to the excitation plane—thus imaging the venous blood that recently moved from the excited plane.<ref name="haacke">{{cite book | vauthors = Haacke EM, Brown RF, Thompson M, Venkatesan R |title=Magnetic resonance imaging: Physical principles and sequence design |publisher=J.

{{anchor|Contrast agents}}

== Contrast agents ==
MRI for imaging anatomical structures or blood flow do not require contrast agents since the varying properties of the tissues or blood provide natural contrasts. However, for more specific types of imaging, [[Exogeny|exogenous]] contrast agents may be given [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]], [[Oral administration|orally]], or [[Joint injection|intra-articularly]].<ref name ="McRobbie"/> Most contrast agents are either paramagnetic (e.g.: gadolinium, manganese, europium), and are used to shorten T1 in the tissue they accumulate in, or super-paramagnetic (SPIONs), and are used to shorten T2 and T2* in healthy tissue reducing its signal intensity (negative contrast agents). The most commonly used intravenous contrast agents are based on [[chelate]]s of [[gadolinium]], which is highly paramagnetic.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors=Rinck PA | title=Magnetic Resonance in Medicine | chapter=Chapter 13: Contrast Agents | chapter-url=http://www.magnetic-resonance.org/ch/13-01.html |date=2014 }}</ref> In general, these agents have proved safer than the iodinated contrast agents used in X-ray radiography or CT.

Gadolinium-based contrast reagents are typically [[polydentate|octadentate]] complexes of [[gadolinium|gadolinium(III)]]. The complex is [[Stability constants of complexes|very stable]] (log K > 20) so that, in use, the concentration of the un-complexed Gd<sup>3+</sup> ions should be below the toxicity limit. The 9th place in the metal ion's [[coordination sphere]] is occupied by a water molecule which exchanges rapidly with water molecules in the reagent molecule's immediate environment, affecting the magnetic resonance [[relaxation time]].<ref>Sergey Shugaev and Peter Caravan, Chapter 1: "Metal Ions in Bio-imaging Techniques: A Short Overview", pp 1-37 in "Metal Ions in Bio-Imaging Techniques" (2021).

In December 2017, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in the [[United States]] announced in a drug safety communication that new warnings were to be included on all gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs). The FDA also called for increased patient education and requiring gadolinium contrast vendors to conduct additional animal and clinical studies to assess the safety of these agents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-warns-gadolinium-based-contrast-agents-gbcas-are-retained-body|title= FDA Drug Safety Communication: FDA warns that gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are retained in the body; requires new class warnings|date=2018-05-16|website=USA [[FDA]]}}</ref>

Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) combines both spectroscopic and imaging methods to produce spatially localized spectra from within the sample or patient. The spatial resolution is much lower (limited by the available [[Signal-to-noise ratio|SNR]]), but the spectra in each voxel contains information about many metabolites. Because the available signal is used to encode spatial and spectral information, MRSI requires high SNR achievable only at higher field strengths (3 T and above).<ref name="DW Al. 2018">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chakeres DW, Abduljalil AM, Novak P, Novak V | title = Comparison of 1.5 and 8 tesla high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging of lacunar infarcts | journal = Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | pages = 628–32 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12218832 | doi = 10.1097/00004728-200207000-00027 | s2cid = 32536398 }}</ref> The high procurement and maintenance costs of MRI with extremely high field strengths<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.medischcontact.nl/nieuws/laatste-nieuws/artikel/mri-scanner-van-7-miljoen-in-gebruik.htm |title=MRI-scanner van 7 miljoen in gebruik |trans-title=MRI scanner of €7 million in use |language=nl |publisher=Medisch Contact |date=December 5, 2007 }}</ref> inhibit their popularity.

=== Interventional MRI ===

A specialized growing subset of [[Interventional magnetic resonance imaging|interventional MRI]] is [[intraoperative MRI]], in which an MRI is used in surgery. Some specialized MRI systems allow imaging concurrent with the surgical procedure. More typically, the surgical procedure is temporarily interrupted so that MRI can assess the success of the procedure or guide subsequent surgical work.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/galeencyclopedia0001unse_r6b8 |title=The Gale Encyclopedia of Nursing and Allied Health |vauthors=Sisk JE |publisher=Gale |year=2013 |isbn=9781414498881 |edition=3rd |location=Farmington, MI |url-access=registration |via=Credo Reference}}</ref>

=== Magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound ===
In guided therapy, [[high-intensity focused ultrasound]] (HIFU) beams are focused on a tissue, that are controlled using MR thermal imaging. Due to the high energy at the focus, the temperature rises to above 65 [[°C]] (150&nbsp;°F) which completely destroys the tissue. This technology can achieve precise [[ablation]] of diseased tissue. MR imaging provides a three-dimensional view of the target tissue, allowing for the precise focusing of ultrasound energy. The MR imaging provides quantitative, real-time, thermal images of the treated area. This allows the physician to ensure that the temperature generated during each cycle of ultrasound energy is sufficient to cause thermal ablation within the desired tissue and if not, to adapt the parameters to ensure effective treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cline HE, Schenck JF, Hynynen K, Watkins RD, Souza SP, Jolesz FA | title = MR-guided focused ultrasound surgery | journal = Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 956–65 | date = 1992 | pmid = 1430448 | doi = 10.1097/00004728-199211000-00024 | s2cid = 11944489 }}</ref>

=== Multinuclear imaging ===
{{See also|Helium-3#Medical imaging}}

Hydrogen has the most frequently imaged [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] in MRI because it is present in biological tissues in great abundance, and because its high [[gyromagnetic ratio]] gives a strong signal. However, any nucleus with a net [[Spin (physics)|nuclear spin]] could potentially be imaged with MRI. Such nuclei include [[helium-3]], [[lithium-7]], [[carbon-13]], [[fluorine]]-19, [[oxygen-17]], [[sodium]]-23, [[phosphorus]]-31 and [[Xenon#Isotopes|xenon-129]]. <sup>23</sup>Na and <sup>31</sup>P are naturally abundant in the body, so they can be imaged directly. Gaseous isotopes such as <sup>3</sup>He or <sup>129</sup>Xe must be [[hyperpolarization (physics)|hyperpolarized]] and then inhaled as their nuclear density is too low to yield a useful signal under normal conditions. [[oxygen-17|<sup>17</sup>O]] and <sup>19</sup>F can be administered in sufficient quantities in liquid form (e.g. [[oxygen-17|<sup>17</sup>O]]-water) that hyperpolarization is not a necessity.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gore JC, Yankeelov TE, Peterson TE, Avison MJ | title = Molecular imaging without radiopharmaceuticals? | journal = Journal of Nuclear Medicine | volume = 50 | issue = 6 | pages = 999–1007 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19443583 | pmc = 2719757 | doi = 10.2967/jnumed.108.059576 | publisher = Society of Nuclear Medicine }}</ref> Using helium or xenon has the advantage of reduced background noise, and therefore increased contrast for the image itself, because these elements are not normally present in biological tissues.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.spl.harvard.edu/archive/HypX/currentresult0.html |title= Hyperpolarized Noble Gas MRI Laboratory: Hyperpolarized Xenon MR Imaging of the Brain |publisher= Harvard Medical School |access-date= 2017-07-26 |archive-date= 2018-09-20 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180920032925/http://www.spl.harvard.edu/archive/HypX/currentresult0.html |url-status= dead }}</ref>

Multinuclear imaging is primarily a research technique at present. However, potential applications include functional imaging and imaging of organs poorly seen on <sup>1</sup>H MRI (e.g., lungs and bones) or as alternative contrast agents. Inhaled hyperpolarized <sup>3</sup>He can be used to image the distribution of air spaces within the lungs. Injectable solutions containing <sup>13</sup>C or stabilized bubbles of hyperpolarized <sup>129</sup>Xe have been studied as contrast agents for angiography and perfusion imaging. <sup>31</sup>P can potentially provide information on bone density and structure, as well as functional imaging of the brain.

=== Molecular imaging by MRI ===
{{Main|Molecular imaging}}

MRI has the advantages of having very high spatial resolution and is very adept at morphological imaging and functional imaging. MRI does have several disadvantages though. First, MRI has a sensitivity of around 10<sup>−3</sup> [[concentration#Molarity|mol/L]] <!--is this what M was supposed to be, molarity? if not, explain and link as appropriate--> to 10<sup>−5</sup> mol/L, which, compared to other types of imaging, can be very limiting. This problem stems from the fact that the population difference between the nuclear spin states is very small at room temperature. For example, at 1.5 [[tesla (unit)|teslas]], a typical field strength for clinical MRI, the difference between high and low energy states is approximately 9 molecules per 2&nbsp;million. Improvements to increase MR sensitivity include increasing magnetic field strength and [[Hyperpolarization (physics)|hyperpolarization]] via optical pumping or dynamic nuclear polarization. There are also a variety of signal amplification schemes based on chemical exchange that increase sensitivity.<ref name="Gallagher2010">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallagher FA | title = An introduction to functional and molecular imaging with MRI | journal = Clinical Radiology | volume = 65 | issue = 7 | pages = 557–66 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20541655 | doi = 10.1016/j.crad.2010.04.006 }}</ref>

To achieve molecular imaging of disease biomarkers using MRI, targeted MRI [[contrast agent]]s with high specificity and high relaxivity (sensitivity) are required.  To date, many studies have been devoted to developing targeted-MRI contrast agents to achieve molecular imaging by MRI.  Commonly, peptides, antibodies, or small ligands, and small protein domains, such as HER-2 affibodies, have been applied to achieve targeting. To enhance the sensitivity of the contrast agents, these targeting moieties are usually linked to high payload MRI contrast agents or MRI contrast agents with high relaxivities.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Xue S, Qiao J, Pu F, Cameron M, Yang JJ | title = Design of a novel class of protein-based magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents for the molecular imaging of cancer biomarkers | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews.

=== Parallel MRI ===
It takes time to gather MRI data using sequential applications of magnetic field gradients.  Even for the most streamlined of [[MRI sequences|MRI sequence]]s, there are physical and physiologic limits to the rate of gradient switching.  Parallel MRI circumvents these limits by gathering some portion of the data simultaneously, rather than in a traditional sequential fashion.  This is accomplished using arrays of radiofrequency (RF) detector coils, each with a different 'view' of the body.  A reduced set of gradient steps is applied, and the remaining spatial information is filled in by combining signals from various coils, based on their known spatial sensitivity patterns.  The resulting acceleration is limited by the number of coils and by the signal to noise ratio (which decreases with increasing acceleration), but two- to four-fold accelerations may commonly be achieved with suitable coil array configurations, and substantially higher accelerations have been demonstrated with specialized coil arrays.  Parallel MRI may be used with most [[MRI sequences|MRI sequence]]s.

After a number of early suggestions for using arrays of detectors to accelerate imaging went largely unremarked in the MRI field, parallel imaging saw widespread development and application following the introduction of the SiMultaneous Acquisition of Spatial Harmonics (SMASH) technique in 1996–7.<ref name="SMASH">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sodickson DK, Manning WJ| title =  Simultaneous acquisition of spatial harmonics (SMASH): fast imaging with radiofrequency coil arrays | journal = Magnetic Resonance in Medicine | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 591–603 | date = October 1997 | pmid = 9324327 | doi = 10.1002/mrm.1910380414 | url=  https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.1910380414 | hdl-access = | s2cid =  17505246| hdl =  }}</ref> The SENSitivity Encoding (SENSE)<ref name="SENSE">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pruessmann KP, Weiger M, Scheidegger MB, Boesiger P| title =  SENSE: sensitivity encoding for fast MRI | journal = Magnetic Resonance in Medicine | volume = 42 | issue = 5 | pages = 952–62 | date = November 1999 | pmid = 10542355 | doi =  10.1002/(SICI)1522-2594(199911)42:5<952::AID-MRM16>3.0.CO;2-S| hdl-access = | s2cid =  16046989 |s2cid-access=free | hdl =  | doi-access = free }}</ref> and Generalized Autocalibrating Partially Parallel Acquisitions (GRAPPA)<ref name="GRAPPA">{{cite journal | vauthors = Griswold MA, Jakob PM, Heidemann RM, Nittka M, Jellus V, Wang J, Kiefer B, Haase A| title =  Generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions (GRAPPA) | journal = Magnetic Resonance in Medicine | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 1202–10 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12111967 | doi = 10.1002/mrm.10171 | hdl-access = | s2cid =  14724155 |s2cid-access=free | hdl =  | doi-access = free }}</ref> techniques are the parallel imaging methods in most common use today.  The advent of parallel MRI resulted in extensive research and development in image reconstruction and RF coil design, as well as in a rapid expansion of the number of receiver channels available on commercial MR systems.  Parallel MRI is now used routinely for MRI examinations in a wide range of body areas and clinical or research applications.

=== Quantitative MRI ===
Most MRI focuses on qualitative interpretation of MR data by acquiring spatial maps of relative variations in signal strength which are "weighted" by certain parameters.<ref name="Gulani-Sieberlich-QMRI-2020">{{cite book|last1=Gulani|first1=Vikas|last2=Nicole|first2=Sieberlich|date=2020|title=Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging|chapter=Quantitative MRI: Rationale and Challenges|publisher=Academic Press|page=xxxvii-li|doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-817057-1.00001-9 |doi-access=free |isbn=9780128170571|s2cid=234995365 |s2cid-access=free |name-list-style=amp }}</ref> Quantitative methods instead attempt to determine spatial maps of accurate tissue relaxometry parameter values or magnetic field, or to measure the size of certain spatial features.

=== Hyperpolarized gas MRI ===
{{Main|Hyperpolarized gas MRI}}

Traditional MRI generates poor images of lung tissue because there are fewer water molecules with protons that can be excited by the magnetic field. Using hyperpolarized gas an MRI scan can identify ventilation defects in the lungs.  Before the scan, a patient is asked to inhale hyperpolarized [[xenon]] mixed with a buffer gas of helium or nitrogen.  The resulting lung images are much higher quality than with traditional MRI.

===Overuse===
{{See also |Overdiagnosis}}

Medical societies issue guidelines for when physicians should use MRI on patients and recommend against overuse. MRI can detect health problems or confirm a diagnosis, but medical societies often recommend that MRI not be the first procedure for creating a plan to diagnose or manage a patient's complaint. A common case is to use MRI to seek a cause of [[low back pain]]; the [[American College of Physicians]], for example, recommends against imaging (including MRI) as unlikely to result in a positive outcome for the patient.<ref name="ACPfive">{{cite journal |author1=Consumer Reports |author2=American College of Physicians |author1-link=Consumer Reports |author2-link=American College of Physicians |others=presented by [[ABIM Foundation]] |title=Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |journal=Choosing Wisely |url=http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_College_Phys.pdf |access-date=August 14, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624075449/http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_College_Phys.pdf |archive-date=June 24, 2012 }}</ref><ref name="backimage">{{cite journal |author1=Consumer Reports |author2=American College of Physicians |author1-link=Consumer Reports |author2-link=American College of Physicians |date=April 2012 |title=Imaging tests for lower-back pain: Why you probably don't need them |journal=High Value Care |url=http://consumerhealthchoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/High-Value-Care-Back-Pain-ACP.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115221844/http://consumerhealthchoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/High-Value-Care-Back-Pain-ACP.pdf | archive-date=15 January 2013 | url-status=dead |access-date=August 14, 2012}}</ref>

==Artifacts==
{{Main|MRI artifact}}
[[File:MRI with motion artifacts.jpg|thumb|Motion artifact (T1 coronal study of cervical vertebrae)<ref name="ErasmusHurter2004"/>]]

An [[MRI artifact]] is a [[visual artifact]], that is, an anomaly during visual representation. Many different artifacts can occur during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), some affecting the diagnostic quality, while others may be confused with pathology. Artifacts can be classified as patient-related, signal processing-dependent and hardware (machine)-related.<ref name="ErasmusHurter2004">{{cite journal |doi=10.4102/sajr.v8i2.127 |title=A short overview of MRI artefacts |journal=South African Journal of Radiology |volume=8 |issue=2 |page=13 |year=2004 | vauthors=Erasmus LJ, Hurter D, Naude M, Kritzinger HG, Acho S |doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Non-medical use==
{{Main|Nuclear magnetic resonance#Applications}}

MRI is used industrially mainly for routine analysis of chemicals. The [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] technique is also used, for example, to measure the ratio between water and fat in foods, monitoring of flow of corrosive fluids in pipes, or to study molecular structures such as catalysts.<ref name="Rinck"/>

Being non-invasive and non-damaging, MRI can be used to study the anatomy of plants, their water transportation processes and water balance.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Van As H | title = Intact plant MRI for the study of cell water relations, membrane permeability, cell-to-cell and long distance water transport | journal = Journal of Experimental Botany | volume = 58 | issue = 4 | pages = 743–56 | date = 2006-11-30 | pmid = 17175554 | doi = 10.1093/jxb/erl157 | publisher = Oxford University Press (OUP) | doi-access = free }}</ref> It is also applied to veterinary radiology for diagnostic purposes. Outside this, its use in zoology is limited due to the high cost; but it can be used on many species.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ziegler A, Kunth M, Mueller S, Bock C, Pohmann R, Schröder L, Faber C, Giribet G | s2cid=43555012 | title=Application of magnetic resonance imaging in zoology | journal=Zoomorphology | publisher=Springer Science and Business Media LLC | volume=130 | issue=4 | date=2011-10-13 | issn=0720-213X | doi=10.1007/s00435-011-0138-8 | pages=227–254| hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0013-B8B0-B | hdl-access=free }}</ref>

[[Forensic science|Forensic]] imaging provides graphic documentation of an [[autopsy]], which manual autopsy does not. CT scanning provides quick whole-body imaging of skeletal and [[parenchyma]]l alterations, whereas MR imaging gives better representation of soft tissue [[pathology]].<ref name="pmid30686369">{{cite journal | vauthors = Filograna L, Pugliese L, Muto M, Tatulli D, Guglielmi G, Thali MJ, Floris R | title = A Practical Guide to Virtual Autopsy: Why, When and How | journal = Seminars in Ultrasound, CT, and MR | volume = 40 | issue = 1 | pages = 56–66 | date = February 2019 | pmid = 30686369 | doi = 10.1053/j.sult.2018.10.011 | s2cid = 59304740 }}</ref> All that being said, MRI is more expensive, and more time-consuming to utilize.<ref name="pmid30686369" /> Moreover, the quality of MR imaging deteriorates below 10&nbsp;°C.<ref name="pmid24191122">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ruder TD, Thali MJ, Hatch GM | title = Essentials of forensic post-mortem MR imaging in adults | journal = The British Journal of Radiology | volume = 87 | issue = 1036 | pages = 20130567 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24191122 | pmc = 4067017 | doi = 10.1259/bjr.20130567 }}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of magnetic resonance imaging}}

In 1971 at [[Stony Brook University]], [[Paul Lauterbur]] applied magnetic field gradients in all three dimensions and a back-projection technique to create NMR images. He published the first images of two tubes of water in 1973 in the journal ''Nature'',<ref name="LAUTERBUR 1973 pp. 190–191">{{cite journal | last=LAUTERBUR | first=P. C. | title=Image Formation by Induced Local Interactions: Examples Employing Nuclear Magnetic Resonance | journal=Nature | publisher=Springer Science and Business Media LLC | volume=242 | issue=5394 | year=1973 | issn=0028-0836 | doi=10.1038/242190a0 | pages=190–191| bibcode=1973Natur.242..190L | s2cid=4176060 }}</ref> followed by the picture of a living animal, a clam, and in 1974 by the image of the thoracic cavity of a mouse. Lauterbur called his imaging method zeugmatography, a term which was replaced by (N)MR imaging.<ref name="Rinck"/> In the late 1970s, physicists [[Peter Mansfield]] and [[Paul Lauterbur]] developed MRI-related techniques, like the [[echo-planar imaging]] (EPI) technique.<ref name="Mansfield-EPI">{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/physrevb.12.3618 |title="Diffraction" and microscopy in solids and liquids by NMR |journal=Physical Review B |volume=12 |issue=9 |pages=3618–34 |year=1975 | vauthors=Mansfield P, Grannell PK |bibcode=1975PhRvB..12.3618M }}</ref>

[[Raymond Damadian]]’s work into [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) has been incorporated into MRI, having built one of the first scanners.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/17/science/raymond-damadian-dead.html|title=Raymond Damadian, Creator of the First M.R.I. Scanner, Dies at 86|first=Richard|last=Sandomir|work=The New York Times |date=August 17, 2022|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

Advances in [[semiconductor]] technology were crucial to the development of practical MRI, which requires a large amount of [[computational power]]. This was made possible by the rapidly increasing number of [[transistors]] on a single [[integrated circuit]] chip.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Rosenblum B, Kuttner F |title=Quantum Enigma: Physics Encounters Consciousness |date=2011 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780199792955 |page=127 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I9kGFX1_oGAC&pg=PT127}}</ref> Mansfield and Lauterbur were awarded the 2003 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for their "discoveries concerning magnetic resonance imaging".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2003|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2003/index.html|publisher=Nobel Foundation|access-date=28 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718172340/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2003/index.html|archive-date=18 July 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>
