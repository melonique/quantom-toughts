I would like to present the idea to my city, to my city, I don't know if it's the park, La Pointe-aux-Lièvres, that should do it. In fact, I need to know who to send the idea to. The idea is that I would like that in the neighborhood of La Pointe-aux-Lièvres, the deglazing used is not salt. That we use a deglazing that is not harmful to the dog's paws. I think it's obvious for the city that the city, a priori, what this place is, is a place for dogs in the city. Especially with the dog park that has been built, but also now with the building of the Dauphinoise, which is with dogs, and also the private buildings recently. I'm not calm. The buildings recently of... What's the name of the building? What's the name of the building? The Verity? The Verity, which has a Lave-Toutou, and all the condo buildings, except all the dogs. So, it's obvious that the city decides that it's a place for dogs. It's just that we use things that are deglazing for the paws of these animals in this neighborhood. It's counterintuitive to hurt animals.
