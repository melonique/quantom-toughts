So, the main idea of this project is to try to find a scientific way to validate an intuition that I had. The intuition is that humans can control the quantum state of particles, neurons, neurotransmitters, etc. They can make them quantum, and being quantum, all of a sudden, they have access to consciously be able to use the laws of quantum physics to have things that look like superpowers. The idea is that since all the neurons in quantum state are in quantum state at the same time, they can entangle and be able to represent the state of the other at a distance. This allows what we call man-to-man contact, or telepathy, or a lot of other things like that. It's also based on mirror neurons. Another concept is that since neurons are in quantum state, in quantum state, time and space are not united. So, sometimes with entanglement, we would go beyond space, among other things, because we could go and look for someone else's neurons. But since we are also in time, we can look for neurons anywhere in humanity. Halfway through, so in the totality of possible and imaginable knowledge of whether humanity will go so far in one of the possible futures. So that gives the example of the Akashic rings, or things like that, that Einstein talks about. I also want to check... It also allows travel to other dimensions. People who have the same ideas of technology all over the world at the same time without necessarily communicating. Empaths. People who have special powers. Chakras. All the knowledge and cultures on how the mind works, the chakras, the connections with the cosmos, these things, it will connect with the ancient civilizations of the past. In short, how can we connect all of this together? It's a kind of transversal study of the interdomain between how the brain works and the human experience versus what is experienced. The human brain has been studied from many angles, and everyone has a really focused vision on their angle. So I want to go more transversally and make correlations between the different things. I will also make correlations with science fiction. Because I think everything is linked, since science fiction is artists who have access to the quantum of space and time, so they see the future in the same way as Nostradamus, or whatever. In short, this intuition, this faith, I'm curious to see if I can base it scientifically. If I can't do it, will it break my faith? I don't know. Do I need my faith to be real for it to exist? It doesn't bother me too much. I think it's fun, but I find it funny. I find it amusing. I may not be able to define it, I don't know. Anyway. We got there. Welcome to my notebook of random research in all directions. On quantum thoughts.
