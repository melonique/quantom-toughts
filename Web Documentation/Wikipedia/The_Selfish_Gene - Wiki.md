'''''The Selfish Gene''''' is a 1976 book on [[evolution]] by [[ethologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]], in which the author builds upon the principal theory of [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]]'s ''[[Adaptation and Natural Selection]]'' (1966). Dawkins uses the term "selfish gene" as a way of expressing the [[gene-centered view of evolution|gene-centred view of evolution]] (as opposed to the views focused on the organism and the [[Group selection|group]]), popularising ideas developed during the 1960s by [[W. D. Hamilton]] and others. From the gene-centred view, it follows that the more two individuals are genetically related, the more sense (at the level of the genes) it makes for them to behave cooperatively with each other.

A [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]] is expected to evolve to maximise its [[inclusive fitness]]—the number of copies of its genes passed on globally (rather than by a particular individual). As a result, populations will tend towards an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]]. The book also introduces the term ''[[meme]]'' for a unit of human [[cultural evolution]] analogous to the gene, suggesting that such "selfish" replication may also model human culture, in a different sense. [[Memetics]] has become the subject of many studies since the publication of the book.  In raising awareness of Hamilton's ideas, as well as making its own valuable contributions to the field, the book has also stimulated research on [[human inclusive fitness]].<ref name="SBNK">{{cite book |author= Holland, Maximilian |year= 2012 |title= Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches |publisher= Createspace Press|title-link= Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship }}</ref>

In the foreword to the book's 30th-anniversary edition, Dawkins said he "can readily see that [the book's title] might give an inadequate impression of its contents" and in retrospect thinks he should have taken [[Tom Maschler]]'s advice and called the book ''The Immortal Gene''.<ref name="timesexcerpt">{{cite news |url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article738678.ece |title= It's all in the genes |last= Dawkins |first= Richard| date= 12 March 2006 |newspaper= [[The Sunday Times]] |access-date= 6 January 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110615135027/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article738678.ece | archive-date= 15 June 2011|ref=none}}</ref>

==Background==
Dawkins builds upon [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]]'s book ''[[Adaptation and Natural Selection]]'' (1966), which argued that [[altruism]] is not based upon [[group selection|group benefit]] ''per se'',<ref name=Williams/> but results from [[natural selection|selection]] that occurs "at the level of the gene mediated by the [[phenotype]]"<ref name=Williams2/> and that any selection at the group level occurred only under rare circumstances.<ref name=Wright/> [[W. D. Hamilton]] and others developed this approach further during the 1960s; they opposed the concepts of [[group selection]] and of selection aimed directly at benefit to the individual organism:<ref name=Hamilton/>

<blockquote>
Despite the principle of '[[survival of the fittest]]' the ultimate criterion which determines whether [a gene] ''G'' will spread is not whether the behavior is to the benefit of the behaver, but whether it is to the benefit of the gene ''G'' ...With altruism this will happen only if the affected individual is a relative of the altruist, therefore having an increased chance of carrying the gene.
:— W. D. Hamilton, ''The Evolution of Altruistic Behavior'' (1963), pp. 354–355.
</blockquote>

Wilkins and Hull (2014) provide an extended discussion of Dawkins's views and of his book ''The Selfish Gene''.<ref name=Hull/>

===Contents===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2021}}Dawkins begins by discussing the altruism that people display, indicating that he will argue it is explained by gene selfishness, and attacking [[group selection]] as an explanation. He considers the [[origin of life]] with the arrival of molecules able to replicate themselves. From there, he looks at [[DNA]]'s role in [[evolution]], and its organisation into [[chromosome]]s and [[gene]]s, which in his view behave selfishly. He describes [[organism]]s as [[teleology in biology|apparently purposive]] but fundamentally simple survival machines, which use [[negative feedback]] to [[homeostasis|achieve control]]. This extends, he argues, to the [[brain]]'s ability to simulate the world with subjective [[consciousness]], and [[signalling theory|signalling between species]]. He then introduces the idea of the [[evolutionarily stable strategy]], and uses it to explain why [[game theory|alternative competitive strategies]] like bullying and retaliating exist. This allows him to consider what selfishness in a gene might actually mean, describing [[W. D. Hamilton]]'s argument for [[kin selection]], that genes for [[ethology|behaviour]] that improves the survival chances of close relatives can spread in a population, because those relatives carry the same genes.

Dawkins examines childbearing and raising children as evolutionary strategies. He attacks the idea of group selection for the good of the species as proposed by [[V. C. Wynne-Edwards]], arguing instead that each parent necessarily behaves selfishly. A question is whether parents should invest in their offspring equally or should favour some of them and explains that what is best for the survival of the parents' genes is not always best for individual children. Similarly, Dawkins argues, there are conflicts of interest between males and females, but he notes that [[R. A. Fisher]] showed that the optimal sex ratio is 50:50. He explains that this is true even in an extreme case like the harem-keeping [[elephant seal]], where 4% of the males get 88% of copulations. In that case, the strategy of having a female offspring is safe, as she'll have a pup, but the strategy of having a male can bring a large return (dozens of pups), even though many males live out their lives as bachelors. [[Amotz Zahavi]]'s theory of [[honest signalling]] explains [[stotting]] as a selfish act, he argues, improving the springbok's chances of escaping from a predator by indicating how difficult the chase would be.

Dawkins discusses why many species live in groups, achieving mutual benefits through mechanisms such as Hamilton's [[selfish herd]] model: each individual behaves selfishly but the result is herd behaviour. Altruism too can evolve, as in the [[social insects]] such as ants and bees, where [[worker bee|workers]] give up the right to reproduce in favour of a sister, the queen; in their case, the unusual ([[haplodiploid]]) system of [[sex determination system|sex determination]] may have helped to bring this about, as females in a nest are exceptionally closely related.

The final chapter of the first edition introduced the idea of the [[meme]], a [[Cultural learning|culturally-transmitted]] entity such as a hummable tune, by analogy to genetic transmission. Dawkins describes God as an old idea which probably arose many times, and which has sufficient psychological appeal to survive effectively in the meme pool. The second edition (1989) added two more chapters.

===Themes===
===="Selfish" genes====
In describing genes as being "selfish", Dawkins states unequivocally that he does not intend to imply that they are driven by any motives or [[Volition (psychology)|will]], but merely that their effects can be metaphorically and pedagogically described ''as if'' they were. His contention is that the genes that are passed on are the ones whose [[evolution]]ary consequences serve their own implicit interest (to continue the [[anthropomorphism]]) in being replicated, not necessarily those of the organism. In later work, Dawkins brings evolutionary "selfishness" down to creation of a widely proliferated [[The Extended Phenotype|''extended phenotype'']].<ref name=ExPh/>

For some, the metaphor of "selfishness" is entirely clear, while to others it is confusing, misleading, or simply silly to ascribe mental attributes to something that is mindless. For example, [[Andrew Brown (Guardian journalist)|Andrew Brown]] has written:<ref>{{cite book |first=Andrew |last=Brown |date=22 December 1998 |url=http://webpages.charter.net/sn9/science/dawkins2.html |title=The Science of Selfishness (book review of ''Unweaving the Rainbow'') |publisher=Salon Media Group |work=Salon}}</ref>

:""Selfish", when applied to genes, doesn't mean "selfish" at all. It means, instead, an extremely important quality for which there is no good word in the English language: "the quality of being copied by a Darwinian selection process." This is a complicated mouthful. There ought to be a better, shorter word—but "selfish" isn't it."

[[Donald Symons]] also finds it inappropriate to use anthropomorphism in conveying scientific meaning in general, and particularly in this instance. He writes in ''[[The Evolution of Human Sexuality]]'' (1979):<ref name=Symons>{{cite book |author-link=Donald Symons |last=Symons |first=Donald |chapter=The semantics of ultimate causation |title=The Evolution of Human Sexuality |page=42 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1981 |isbn=978-0195029079 |edition=Paperback |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lkISQRDurU0C}}</ref>

:"In summary, the rhetoric of ''The Selfish Gene'' exactly reverses the real situation: through [the use of] metaphor genes are endowed with properties only sentient beings can possess, such as selfishness, while sentient beings are stripped of these properties and called machines...The anthropomorphism of genes...obscures the deepest mystery in the life sciences: the origin and nature of mind."

===="Replicators"====
Dawkins proposes the idea of the "replicator":<ref name=DawkinsRep>{{cite book |title=The Selfish Gene |author=Dawkins, Richard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OirfBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT231 |publisher=Best Books |year=1976}}
</ref>

:"It is finally time to return to the problem with which we started, to the tension between individual organism and gene as rival candidates for the central role in natural selection...One way of sorting this whole matter out is to use the terms ‘replicator’ and ‘vehicle’. The fundamental units of natural selection, the basic things that survive or fail to survive, that form lineages of identical copies with occasional random mutations, are called replicators. DNA molecules are replicators. They generally, for reasons that we shall come to, gang together into large communal survival machines or 'vehicles'."
::— Richard Dawkins, ''The Selfish Gene'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=EJeHTt8hW7UC&pg=PA253 p. 253] (Anniversary Edition)

The original replicator (Dawkins ''<u>R</u>eplicator'') was the initial [[molecule]] which first managed to reproduce itself and thus gained an advantage over other molecules within the [[Abiogenesis#"Primordial soup theory|primordial soup]].<ref name=Replicator>{{cite book |title=The Selfish Gene |page=15 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EJeHTt8hW7UC&pg=PA15 |quote=At some point a particularly remarkable molecule was formed by accident. We will call it the ''Replicator''. It may not necessarily have been the biggest or the most complex molecule around, but it had the extraordinary property of being able to create copies of itself |author=Dawkins, Richard|isbn=9780191537554 |date=2006-03-16 |publisher=OUP Oxford }}</ref> As replicating molecules became more complex, Dawkins postulates, the replicators became the genes within organisms, with each organism's body serving the purpose of a 'survival machine' for its genes.

Dawkins writes that gene combinations which help an organism to survive and reproduce tend to also improve the gene's own chances of being replicated, and, as a result, "successful" genes frequently provide a benefit to the organism. An example of this might be a gene that protects the organism against a disease. This helps the gene spread, and also helps the organism.

====Genes vs organisms====
There are other times when the implicit interests of the vehicle and replicator are in conflict, such as the genes behind certain male spiders' instinctive mating behaviour, which increase the organism's [[inclusive fitness]] by allowing it to reproduce but shorten its life by exposing it to the risk of [[Spider cannibalism|being eaten by the cannibalistic female]]. Another example is the existence of [[Intragenomic conflict|segregation distorter]] genes that are detrimental to their host, but nonetheless propagate themselves at its expense.<ref name=DawkinsUR/> Likewise, the persistence of [[Noncoding DNA#Junk DNA|junk DNA]] that [Dawkins believed at that time] provides no benefit to its host can be explained on the basis that it is not subject to selection. These unselected for but transmitted DNA variations connect the individual genetically to its parents but confer no survival benefit.<ref name=DawkinsUR2/>

These examples might suggest that there is a power struggle between genes and their interactor. In fact, the claim is that there isn't much of a struggle because the genes usually win without a fight. However, the claim is made that if the organism becomes intelligent enough to understand its own interests, as distinct from those of its genes, there can be true conflict.

An example of such a conflict might be a person using birth control to prevent fertilisation, thereby inhibiting the replication of his or her genes. But this action might not be a conflict of the 'self-interest' of the organism with his or her genes, since a person using birth control might also be enhancing the survival chances of their genes by limiting family size to conform with available resources, thus avoiding extinction as predicted under the [[Malthusian]] model of population growth.

====Altruism====
Dawkins says that his "purpose" in writing ''The Selfish Gene'' is "to examine the biology of selfishness and altruism." He does this by supporting the claim that "gene selfishness will usually give rise to selfishness in individual behaviour. However, as we shall see, there are special circumstances in which a gene can achieve its own selfish goals best by fostering a limited form of [[altruism]] at the level of individual animals." Gene selection provides one explanation for [[kin selection]] and [[eusociality]], where organisms act altruistically, against their individual interests (in the sense of health, safety or personal reproduction), namely the argument that by helping related organisms reproduce, a gene succeeds in "helping" copies of themselves (or sequences with the same [[phenotype|phenotypic effect]]) in other bodies to replicate. The claim is made that these "selfish" actions of genes lead to unselfish actions by organisms. A requirement upon this claim, supported by Dawkins in Chapter 10: "You scratch my back, I'll ride on yours" by examples from nature, is the need to explain how genes achieve [[kin recognition]], or manage to orchestrate [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] and [[coevolution]]. Although Dawkins (and biologists in general) recognize these phenomena result in more copies of a gene, evidence is inconclusive whether this success is selected for at a group or individual level. In fact, Dawkins has proposed that it is at the level of the [[The Extended Phenotype|''extended phenotype'']]:<ref name=ExPh/><ref name=Bury>
{{cite journal |author=Dawkins, Richard |title=Burying the Vehicle: Commentary |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=17 |number=4 |pages=616–617 |year=1994 |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/248092678/Burying-the-Vehicle#scribd |doi=10.1017/s0140525x00036207|s2cid=143378724 }}</ref> 
:"We agree [referring to Wilson and Sober's book ''Unto others: The evolution and psychology of unselfish behavior''] that genes are replicators, organisms and groups are not. We agree that the group selection controversy ought to be a controversy about groups as vehicles, and we could easily agree to differ on the answer...I coined the [term] vehicle not to praise it but to bury it....Darwinism can work on replicators whose phenotypic effects (interactors) are too diffuse, too multi-levelled, too incoherent to deserve the accolade of vehicle...Extended phenotypes can include inanimate artifacts like beaver dams...But the vehicle is not something fundamental...Ask rather 'Is there a vehicle in this situation and, if so, why?'"
::—Richard Dawkins, ''Burying the Vehicle''

Although Dawkins agrees that groups can assist survival, they rank as a "vehicle" for survival only if the group activity is replicated in descendants, recorded in the gene, the gene being the only true replicator. An improvement in the survival lottery for the group must improve that for the gene for sufficient replication to occur. Dawkins argues qualitatively that the lottery for the gene is based upon a very long and broad record of events, and group advantages are usually too specific, too brief, and too fortuitous to change the gene lottery:
::"We can now see that the organism and the group of organisms are true rivals for the vehicle role in the story, but neither of them is even a ''candidate'' for the replicator role.  The controversy between ‘individual selection’ and ‘group selection’ is a real controversy between alternative vehicles...As it happens the outcome, in my view, is a decisive victory for the individual organism. The group is too wishy-washy an entity." 
::—Richard Dawkins, ''The Selfish Gene'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=WkHO9HI7koEC&pg=PA254 pp. 254–255]

Prior to the 1960s, it was common for altruism to be explained in terms of [[group selection]], where the benefits to the organism or even population were supposed to account for the popularity of the genes responsible for the tendency towards that behaviour. Modern versions of [[Multilevel selection theory|"multilevel selection"]] claim to have overcome the original objections,<ref name=Korb>{{cite book |title=Animal Behaviour: Evolution and Mechanisms |author=Judith Korb |chapter=§7.4—The level of selection debate: multilevel selection |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ej953ZCO_Q8C&pg=PA195 |pages =195 ''ff'' |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3642026232  |year=2010 |editor=Peter Kappeler}}</ref> namely, that at that time no known form of group selection led to an evolutionarily stable strategy. The claim still is made by some that it would take only a single individual with a tendency towards more selfish behaviour to undermine a population otherwise filled only with the gene for altruism towards non-kin.<ref name=PinkerS>Pinker describes the futility of the "Public Good Game" where individuals elect not to aid the group: {{cite book |title=The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature |author-link=Steven Pinker|author=Pinker, Steven |page=257 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePNi4ZqYdVQC&pg=PA257 |isbn=9781101200322 |year=2003 |publisher=Penguin}}</ref>

==Reception==
''The Selfish Gene'' was extremely popular when first published, causing "a silent and almost immediate revolution in biology",{{Sfn|Grafen & Ridley|p=72}} and it continues to be widely read. It has sold over a million copies and has been translated into more than 25 languages.{{Sfn|Dawkins|2006}} Proponents argue that the central point, that replicating the gene is the object of selection, usefully completes and extends the explanation of evolution given by [[Charles Darwin]] before the basic mechanisms of [[genetics]] were understood.

According to the ethologist [[Alan Grafen]], acceptance of adaptionist theories is hampered by a lack of a mathematical unifying theory and a belief that anything in words alone must be suspect.<ref name=Grafen>{{cite book |title=Richard Dawkins: How a scientist changed the way we think |author1-link=Alan Grafen |last1=Grafen |first1=Alan |author2-link=Mark Ridley (zoologist) |last2=Ridley |first2=Mark |page=[https://archive.org/details/richarddawkinsho00alan/page/68 68] |url=https://archive.org/details/richarddawkinsho00alan |url-access=registration |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=9780191500770}}</ref> According to Grafen, these difficulties along with an initial conflict with population genetics models at the time of its introduction "explains why within biology the considerable scientific contributions it [''The Selfish Gene''] makes are seriously underestimated, and why it is viewed mainly as a work of exposition."<ref name=Grafen/> According to comparative psychologist Nicky Hayes, "Dawkins presented a version of sociobiology that rested heavily on metaphors drawn from animal behavior, and extrapolated these...One of the weaknesses of the sociological approach is that it tends only to seek confirmatory examples from among the huge diversity of animal behavior. Dawkins did not deviate from this tradition."<ref name=Hayes>{{cite book |title=Principles Of Comparative Psychology |author=Hayes, Nicky |page=33 |chapter=The "selfish gene" theory |isbn=978-1317758754 |year=2014 |edition=Digital printing of 1996 |publisher=Psychology Press |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tsx7AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA33}}</ref> More generally, critics argue that ''The Selfish Gene'' oversimplifies the relationship between genes and the organism. (As an example, see Thompson.<ref name=Thompson2/>)

''The Selfish Gene'' further popularised [[sociobiology]] in Japan after its translation in 1980.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal |last=Sakura |first=Osamu |date=1 July 1998 |title=Similarities and Varieties: A Brief Sketch on the Reception of Darwinism and Sociobiology in Japan |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=341–357 |doi=10.1023/A:1006504623820|s2cid=169325555 }}</ref> With the addition of Dawkins's book to the country's consciousness, the term "meme" entered popular culture.

In 1976, the ecologist [[Arthur Cain]], one of Dawkins's tutors at Oxford in the 1960s, called it a "young man's book" (which Dawkins points out was a deliberate quote of a commentator on the [[New College, Oxford]]{{efn|Dawkins's college.}} philosopher [[A. J. Ayer]]'s ''[[Language, Truth, and Logic]]'' (1936)). Dawkins noted that he had been "flattered by the comparison, [but] knew that Ayer had recanted much of his first book and [he] could hardly miss Cain's pointed implication that [he] should, in the fullness of time, do the same."<ref name="timesexcerpt" /> This point also was made by the philosopher [[Mary Midgley]]: "The same thing happened to AJ Ayer, she says, but he spent the rest of his career taking back what he'd written in ''Language, Truth and Logic''. "This hasn't occurred to Dawkins", she says. "He goes on saying the same thing.""<ref name="Guardian">{{cite journal |title=Mary Midgley: a late stand for a philosopher with soul  |journal=The Guardian |author=Anthony, Andrew |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/23/mary-midgley-philosopher-soul-human-consciousness |date=3 June 2014}}</ref> However, according to Wilkins and Hull,<ref name="Hull2">{{cite journal |author1=Wilkins, John S. |author2=Hull, David |title=Replication and Reproduction |journal=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2014 Edition) |editor=Zalta, Edward N. |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/replication/#DawRepVeh |date=January 2014}}</ref> Dawkins's thinking has developed, although perhaps not defusing this criticism:

:"In Dawkins's early writings, replicators and vehicles played different but complementary and equally important roles in selection, but as Dawkins honed his view of the evolutionary process, vehicles became less and less fundamental... In later writings Dawkins goes even further and argues that phenotypic traits are what really matter in selection and that they can be treated independently of their being organized into vehicles....Thus, it comes as no surprise when Dawkins  proclaims that he "coined the term ‘vehicle’ not to praise it but to bury it."<ref name=Bury/> As prevalent as organisms might be, as determinate as the causal roles that they play in selection are, reference to them can and must be omitted from any perspicuous characterization of selection in the evolutionary process. Dawkins is far from a genetic ''determinist'', but he is certainly a genetic ''reductionist''."

===Units of selection===
As to the [[unit of selection]]: "One internally consistent logical picture is that the unit of replication is the gene,...and the organism is one kind of ...entity on which selection acts directly."<ref name=Keller>{{cite book |title=Levels of Selection in Evolution |editor=Keller, Laurent |author1=Reeve, H.

It is the gene, the unit of heredity."<ref name=Dawkins76A>{{cite book |title=The Selfish Gene  |chapter=Chapter 1: Why are people? |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WkHO9HI7koEC&pg=PA11 |page=11 |edition=30th Anniversary |isbn=978-0199291144 |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |author=Dawkins, Richard}}</ref> However, he continues in a later chapter:

:"On any sensible view of the matter Darwinian selection does not work on genes directly. ...The important differences between genes emerge only in their ''effects''. The technical word ''phenotype'' is used for the bodily manifestation of a gene, the effect that a gene has on the body...Natural selection favours some genes rather than others not because of the nature of the genes themselves, but because of their consequences—their phenotypic effects...But we shall now see that the phenotypic effects of a gene need to be thought of as ''all the effects that it has on the world''. ...The phenotypic effects of a gene are the tools by which it levers itself into the next generation. All I am going to add is that the tools may reach outside the individual body wall...Examples that spring to mind are artefacts like beaver dams, bird nests, and caddis houses." 
::— Richard Dawkins, ''The Selfish Gene'', Chapter 13, pp. 234, 235, 238

Dawkins's later formulation is in his book ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]'' (1982), where the process of selection is taken to involve every possible [[Phenotype|phenotypical]] effect of a gene.

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] finds Dawkins's position tries to have it both ways:<ref name=GouldSJ>{{cite book |title=The Structure of Evolutionary Theory |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |author-link=Stephen Jay Gould |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6LMrAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA640 |pages=640–641 |isbn=978-0674417922 |year=2002 |publisher=Harvard University Press}}</ref>

:"Dawkins claims to prefer genes and to find greater insight in this formulation. But he allows that you or I might prefer organisms—and it really doesn't matter."
::— Stephen Jay Gould, ''The Structure of Evolutionary Theory'', pp. 640-641

In ''[[The Social Conquest of Earth]]'' (2012), the entomologist [[E. O. Wilson]] contends that although the selfish-gene approach was accepted "until 2010 [when] Martin Nowak, Corina Tarnita, and I demonstrated that inclusive fitness theory, often called kin selection theory, is both mathematically and biologically incorrect."<ref name=Wilson>{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Edward |title=The Social Conquest of Earth |year=2012 |publisher=Liveright Publishing |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-87140-413-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/socialconquestof0000wils/page/143 143] |url=https://archive.org/details/socialconquestof0000wils|url-access=registration }} Although it contains no reference to the "selfish gene", Wilson probably is referring to {{cite journal |title=The evolution of eusociality |author1=Nowak, M.

He criticises earlier approaches to social evolution, saying: "...unwarranted faith in the central role of kinship in social evolution has led to the reversal of the usual order in which biological research is conducted. The proven best way in evolutionary biology, as in most of science, is to define a problem arising during empirical research, then select or devise the theory that is needed to solve it. Almost all research in inclusive-fitness theory has been the opposite:  hypothesize the key roles of kinship and kin selection, then look for evidence to test that hypothesis." According to Wilson: "People must have a tribe...Experiments conducted over many years by social psychologists have revealed how swiftly and decisively people divide into groups, and then discriminate in favor of the one to which they belong." (pp.&nbsp;57, 59) According to Wilson: "Different parts of the brain have evolved by group selection to create groupishness." (p.&nbsp;61)

Some authors consider facets of this debate between Dawkins and his critics about the level of selection to be blather:<ref name=Keller2>{{cite book |title=Levels of Selection in Evolution |author1=H Kern Reeve |author2=Laurent Keller |editor=Laurent Keller |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5b_iEzNFlBUC&pg=PA4 |page=4 |chapter=Burying the debate over whether genes or individuals are the units of selection |isbn=978-0691007045 |year=1999 |publisher=Princeton University Press}}</ref>
:"The particularly frustrating aspects of these constantly renewed debates is that, even though they seemed to be sparked by rival theories about how evolution works, in fact they often involve only rival metaphors for the very same evolutionary logic and [the debates over these aspects] are thus empirically empty."
::— Laurent Keller, ''Levels of Selection in Evolution'', p.4

Other authors say Dawkins has failed to make some critical distinctions, in particular, the difference between group selection for group advantage and group selection conveying individual advantage.<ref name=Lloyd>{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to the Philosophy of Biology |author=Lloyd, Elizabeth |chapter=Units and Levels of Selection |pages=54–57 |isbn=978-1139827621 |year=2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZOgg-x4UyIC&pg=PA54 |editor1=Hull, David L. |editor2=Ruse, Michael}}</ref>

===Choice of words===
A good deal of objection to ''The Selfish Gene'' stemmed from its failure to be always clear about "selection" and "replication". Dawkins says the gene is the fundamental unit of selection, and then points out that selection does not act directly upon the gene, but upon "vehicles" or '"extended phenotypes". [[Stephen Jay Gould]] took exception to calling the gene a 'unit of selection' because selection acted only upon [[phenotype]]s.<ref name="onselfishgenesinpandasthumb">{{cite book |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |author-link=Stephen Jay Gould |year=1990 |chapter=Caring Groups and Selfish Genes |title=The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History |location=Harmondsworth |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |pages=[https://archive.org/details/pandasthumbmorer00goul/page/72 72–78] |isbn=978-0-393-01380-1 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z0XY7Rg_lOwC |url=https://archive.org/details/pandasthumbmorer00goul/page/72 }}</ref> Summarizing the Dawkins-Gould difference of view, Sterelny says:<ref name=Sterelny>{{cite book |title=Dawkins ''vs.'' Gould: Survival of the Fittest |author=Sterelny, Kim |isbn=978-1840467802 |publisher=Icon Books |year=2003 |page=83 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwpFAQAAIAAJ}}</ref>

:"Gould thinks gene differences do not cause evolutionary changes in populations, they register those changes." 
::—Kim Sterelny: ''Dawkins ''vs.'' Gould'', p. 83

The word "cause" here is somewhat tricky: does a change in lottery rules (for example, inheriting a defective gene "responsible" for a disorder) "cause" differences in outcome that might or might not occur? It certainly alters the likelihood of events, but a concatenation of contingencies decides what actually occurs. Dawkins thinks the use of "cause" as a statistical weighting is acceptable in common usage.<ref name=DawkinsDC>{{cite book |title=A Devil's Chaplain: Reflections on Hope, Lies, Science, and Love |author=Dawkins, Richard  |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=loVMMlxC1XoC&pg=PA106E |page=106 |chapter=§2.4 Genes aren't us |isbn=9780618485390 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |year=2004}}
</ref> Like Gould, Gabriel Dover in criticizing ''The Selfish Gene'' says:<ref name=Dover>{{cite book |title=Dear Mr. Darwin: Letters on the Evolution of Life and Human Nature |isbn=9780520227903 |year=2000 |publisher=University of California Press |author=Dover, Gabriel A. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sElrZSzoLYMC&pg=PA56 |page=56}}</ref>

:"It is illegitimate to give 'powers' to genes, as Dawkins would have it, to control the outcome of selection...There are no genes for interactions, as such: rather, each unique set of inherited genes contributes interactively to one unique phenotype...the true determinants of selection".
::— Gabriel Dover: ''Dear Mr. Darwin'', p. 56

However, from a comparison with Dawkins's discussion of this very same point, it would seem both Gould's and Dover's comments are more a critique of his sloppy usage than a difference of views.<ref name=Keller2/> Hull suggested a resolution based upon a distinction between replicators and interactors.<ref name=HullDL>{{cite journal |author=Hull, David L. |title=Individuality and selection |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |year=1980 |volume=11 |pages=311–32 |url=http://www.joelvelasco.net/teaching/167/Hull%201980%20-%20Individuality%20and%20Selection.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419005656/http://joelvelasco.net/teaching/167/Hull%201980%20-%20Individuality%20and%20Selection.pdf |archive-date=2012-04-19 |url-status=live |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.11.110180.001523}}</ref> The term "replicator" includes genes as the most fundamental replicators but possibly other agents, and ''interactor'' includes organisms but maybe other agents, much as do Dawkins's 'vehicles'. The distinction is as follows:<ref name=HullDL/><ref name=GodfreySmith>{{cite journal |author=Godfrey-Smith, Peter |title=The replicator in retrospect |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=15 |issue=3 |year=2000 |pages=403–423 |url=http://joelvelasco.net/teaching/167win10/PGS%2000%20-%20the%20replicator%20in%20retrospect.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114249/http://joelvelasco.net/teaching/167win10/PGS%2000%20-%20the%20replicator%20in%20retrospect.pdf |archive-date=2015-04-02 |url-status=live |doi=10.1023/a:1006704301415|s2cid=5906040 }}</ref>

:''replicator'': an entity that passes on its structure largely intact in successive replications.
:''interactor'': an entity that interacts as a cohesive whole with its environment in such a way that this interaction ''causes'' replication to be differential.
:''selection'': a process in which the differential extinction or proliferation of interactors causes the differential perpetuation of the replicators that produced them.

Hull suggests that, despite some similarities, Dawkins takes too narrow a view of these terms, engendering some of the objections to his views. According to Godfrey-Smith, this more careful vocabulary has cleared up "misunderstandings in the "units of selection" debates."<ref name=GodfreySmith/>

===Enactive arguments===
[[Behavioural genetics]] entertains the view:

:"that genes are dynamic contributors to behavioral organization and are sensitive to feedback systems from the internal and external environments." "Technically behavior is not inherited; only DNA molecules are inherited. From that point on behavioral formation is a problem of constant interplay between genetic potential and environmental shaping"<ref name=Thiessen>{{cite book |chapter=Mechanism specific approaches in behavior genetics |author=Thiessen, D.

[[Regulation of gene expression|Gene activation]] depends upon the cellular milieu. An extended discussion of the contrasts between enactivism and Dawkins's views, and with their support by [[Daniel Dennett|Dennett]], is provided by Thompson.<ref name=Thompson>{{cite book |title=Mind in Life: Biology, Phenomenology, and the Sciences of Mind |author=Evan Thompson |chapter=Chapter 7: Laying down a path in walking: Development and evolution |pages=166 ''ff'' |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVGna4ZEpWwC&pg=PA166 |isbn=978-0674025110 |year=2007 |publisher=Harvard University Press|author-link=Evan Thompson }}</ref>

In ''Mind in Life'', the philosopher Evan Thompson has assembled a multi-sourced objection to the "selfish gene" idea.<ref name=Thompson/> Thompson takes issue with Dawkin's reduction of "life" to "genes" and "information":
:"Life is just bytes and bytes and bytes of digital information"<ref name=DawkinsRE>{{cite book |title= River out of Eden: A Darwinian View |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxmKvnPyBSoC&pg=PA19 |page=19 |isbn=9780786724260 |publisher=Basic Books  |year=2008 |edition=Paperback reprint of 1995 }}</ref>
:::— Richard Dawkins: ''River out of Eden: A Darwinian View of Life'', p. 19

:"On the bank of the Oxford canal...is a large willow tree, and it is pumping downy seeds into the air...It is raining instructions out there; it's raining programs; it's raining tree-growing, fluff-spreading algorithms. That is not a metaphor, it is the plain truth"<ref name=DawkinsBW>{{cite book |author=Dawkins, Richard |title=The Blind Watchmaker |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sPpaZnZMDG0C&pg=PA111 |page=111 |isbn=978-0393315707 |year=1986 |publisher=W. W. Norton & Company}}</ref>

::— Richard Dawkins: ''The Blind Watchmaker'', p. 111

Thompson objects that the gene cannot operate by itself, since it requires an environment such as a cell, and life is "the creative outcome of highly structured contingencies". Thompson quotes Sarkar:<ref name="Sarkar"/>

:"there is no clear technical notion of "information" in molecular biology. It is little more than a metaphor that masquerades as a theoretical concept and ...leads to a misleading picture of the nature of possible explanations in molecular biology."
::— Sahotra Sarkar ''Biological information: a skeptical look at some central dogmas of molecular biology'', p. 187

Thompson follows with a detailed examination of the concept of [[DNA]] as a look-up-table and the role of the cell in orchestrating the DNA-to-RNA [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]], indicating that by anyone's account the DNA is hardly the whole story. Thompson goes on to suggest that the cell-environment interrelationship has much to do with reproduction and inheritance, and a focus on the gene as a form of "information [that] passes through bodies and affects them but is not affected by them on its way through"<ref name=DawkinsRE1>{{cite book |title= River out of Eden: A Darwinian View |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxmKvnPyBSoC&pg=PA4 |page=4 |isbn=978-0786724260 |publisher=Basic Books |year=2008 |edition=Paperback |orig-year=1995}}</ref> is tantamount to adoption of a form of material-informational dualism that has no explanatory value and no scientific basis. (Thomson, p.&nbsp;187) The [[Enactivism|enactivist]] view, however, is that information results from the probing and experimentation of the agent with the agent's environment subject to the limitations of the agent's abilities to probe and process the result of probing, and DNA is simply one mechanism the agent brings to bear upon its activity.

===Moral arguments===
Another criticism of the book is its treatment of morality, and more particularly altruism, as existing only as a form of selfishness:

:"It is important to realize that the above definitions of altruism and selfishness are ''behavioural'', not subjective. I am not concerned here with the psychology of motives...My definition is concerned only with whether the effect of an act is to lower or raise the survival prospects of the presumed altruist and the survival prospects of the presumed beneficiary." 
::— Richard Dawkins, ''The Selfish Gene'', p. 12 
:"We can even discuss ways of cultivating and nurturing pure, disinterested altruism, something that has no place in nature, something that has never existed before in the whole history of the world."
::— Richard Dawkins, ''The Selfish Gene'', p. 179

The philosopher [[Mary Midgley]] has suggested this position is a variant of [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes's]] explanation of altruism as [[enlightened self-interest]], and that Dawkins goes a step further to suggest that our genetic programming can be overcome by what amounts to an extreme version of [[free will]].<ref name=Midgley/> Part of Mary Midgley's concern is that Richard Dawkins's account of ''The Selfish Gene'' serves as a moral and ideological justification for selfishness to be adopted by modern human societies as simply following "nature", providing an excuse for behavior with bad consequences for future human society.

Dawkins's major concluding theme, that humanity is finally gaining power over the "selfish replicators" by virtue of their intelligence, is criticized also by [[primatologist]] [[Frans de Waal]], who refers to it as an example of a "[[veneer theory]]" (the idea that [[morality]] is not fundamental, but is laid over a brutal foundation).<ref name=deWaal>{{cite book |last=De Waal |first=Frans |title=Primates and Philosophers: How morality evolved |quote=Dawkins waited until the very last sentence of ''The Selfish Gene'' to reassure us that, in fact, we are welcome to chuck all those genes out the window: "We alone on earth can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish gene replicators." |isbn=978-1400830336 |year=2009 |publisher=Princeton University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PccMuO2pcOcC&pg=PA9 |page=9}}

==Publication==
''The Selfish Gene'' was first published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 1976 in eleven chapters with a preface by the author and a foreword by [[Robert Trivers]].{{Sfn|Dawkins|1976}} A second edition was published in 1989. This edition added two extra chapters, and substantial endnotes to the preceding chapters, reflecting new findings and thoughts. It also added a second preface by the author, but the original foreword by Trivers was dropped. The book contains no illustrations.

The book has been translated into at least 23 languages including Arabic, Thai and Turkish.<ref>{{cite web|title=ti:The Selfish Gene au:Richard Dawkins|url=https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=ti%3AThe+Selfish+Gene+au%3ARichard+Dawkins&fq=x0%3Abook+%3E+-mt%3Afic&dblist=638&fc=ln:_25&qt=show_more_ln%3A&cookie|publisher=WorldCat|access-date=13 May 2018}}</ref>

In 2006, a 30th-anniversary edition{{Sfn|Dawkins|2006}} was published with the Trivers foreword and a new introduction by the author in which he states, "This edition does, however---and it is a source of particular joy to me---restore the original Foreword by Robert Trivers."  This edition was accompanied by a ''[[festschrift]]'' entitled ''[[Richard Dawkins: How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think]]'' (2006). In March 2006, a special event entitled ''The Selfish Gene'': Thirty Years On was held at the [[London School of Economics]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Selfish Gene: Thirty years on |url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/CPNSS/research/projectsCurrentlyOnHold/darwin/events/sg/Home.aspx |publisher=London School of Economics |access-date=18 November 2017 |archive-date=1 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201032122/http://www.lse.ac.uk/CPNSS/research/projectsCurrentlyOnHold/darwin/events/sg/Home.aspx |url-status=dead }}</ref> In March 2011, Audible Inc published an audiobook edition narrated by Richard Dawkins and [[Lalla Ward]].
