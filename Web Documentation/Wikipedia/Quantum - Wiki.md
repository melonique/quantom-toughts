{{Short description|Minimum amount of a physical entity involved in an interaction}}
{{Other uses|Quantum (disambiguation)}}

In [[physics]], a '''quantum''' ({{plural form}}: '''quanta''') is the minimum amount of any physical entity ([[physical property]]) involved in an [[fundamental interaction|interaction]]. Quantum is a discrete quantity of energy proportional in magnitude to the frequency of the radiation it represents. The fundamental notion that a property can be "quantized" is referred to as "the hypothesis of [[quantization (physics)|quantization]]".<ref>Wiener, N. (1966). ''Differential Space, Quantum Systems, and Prediction''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press</ref> This means that the [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the physical property can take on only [[Wiktionary:discrete|discrete]] values consisting of [[Multiple (mathematics)|integer multiples]] of one quantum. For example, a [[photon]] is a single quantum of [[light]] of a specific [[frequency]] (or of any other form of [[electromagnetic radiation]]). Similarly, the energy of an [[electron]] bound within an [[atom]] is quantized and can exist only in certain discrete values.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rovelli |first=Carlo |title=Reality is not what it seems: the elementary structure of things |date=January 2017 |publisher=Riverhead Books |isbn=978-0-7352-1392-0 |edition=1st American |location=New York, New York |pages=109–130 |translator-last=Carnell |translator-first=Simon |translator-last2=Segre |translator-first2=Erica}}</ref> Atoms and matter in general are stable because electrons can exist only at discrete energy levels within an atom. Quantization is one of the foundations of the much broader physics of [[quantum mechanics]]. Quantization of [[energy]] and its influence on how energy and matter interact ([[quantum electrodynamics]]) is part of the fundamental framework for understanding and describing nature.

==Etymology and discovery==
The word ''quantum'' is the neuter singular of the [[Latin]] interrogative adjective ''quantus'', meaning "how much". "Quanta", the neuter plural, short for "quanta of electricity" (electrons), was used in a 1902 article on the [[photoelectric effect]] by [[Philipp Lenard]], who credited [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] for using the word in the area of electricity. However, the word ''quantum'' in general was well known before 1900,<ref>E. Cobham Brewer 1810–1897. [http://www.bartleby.com/81/13830.html Dictionary of Phrase and Fable. 1898.] {{Web archive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630232946/http://www.bartleby.com/81/13830.html |date=2017-06-30 }}</ref> e.g. ''quantum'' was used in E. A. Poe's [[Loss of Breath]]. It was often used by [[physicians]], such as in the term ''[[quantum satis]]'', "the amount which is enough". Both Helmholtz and [[Julius von Mayer]] were physicians as well as physicists. Helmholtz used ''quantum'' with reference to heat in his article<ref>[http://www.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/helios/fachinfo/www/math/edd/helmholtz/R-Mayer.pdf E.

The concept of quantization of radiation was discovered in 1900 by [[Max Planck]], who had been trying to understand the emission of radiation from heated objects, known as [[black-body radiation]]. By assuming that energy can be absorbed or released only in tiny, differential, discrete packets (which he called "bundles", or "energy elements"),<ref>{{cite journal |author=Max Planck |title=Ueber das Gesetz der Energieverteilung im Normalspectrum (On the Law of Distribution of Energy in the Normal Spectrum) |url=http://dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/webdocs/Chem-History/Planck-1901/Planck-1901.html |journal=Annalen der Physik |volume= 309 |doi=10.1002/andp.19013090310 |page=553 |year=1901 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080418002757/http://dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/webdocs/Chem-History/Planck-1901/Planck-1901.html |archive-date = 2008-04-18 |bibcode = 1901AnP...309..553P |issue=3 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Planck accounted for certain objects changing color when heated.<ref>Brown, T., LeMay, H., Bursten, B.

After his theory was validated, Planck was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his discovery in 1918.

== Quantization ==
{{main article| Quantization (physics)}}
While quantization was first discovered in [[electromagnetic radiation]], it describes a fundamental aspect of energy not just restricted to photons.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Parker |first=Will |date=2005-02-11 |title=Real-World Quantum Effects Demonstrated |url=http://www.scienceagogo.com/news/20050110221715data_trunc_sys.shtml |access-date=2023-08-20 |website=ScienceAGoGo |language=en-US}}</ref>
In the attempt to bring theory into agreement with experiment, Max Planck postulated that electromagnetic energy is absorbed or emitted in discrete packets, or quanta.<ref>Modern Applied Physics-Tippens third edition; McGraw-Hill.</ref><!-- This source is vague -->
