'''Quantum entanglement''' is the phenomenon of a group of [[particle]]s being generated, interacting, or sharing spatial proximity in such a way that the [[quantum state]] of each particle of the group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, including when the particles are separated by a large distance. The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between [[classical physics|classical]] and [[quantum physics]]: entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics not present in classical mechanics.<ref name="NYT-20221010">{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |author-link=Dennis Overbye |date=10 October 2022 |title=Black Holes May Hide a Mind-Bending Secret About Our Universe – Take gravity, add quantum mechanics, stir.

[[Measurement#Quantum mechanics|Measurements]] of [[physical properties]] such as [[position (vector)|position]], [[momentum]], [[Spin (physics)|spin]], and [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] performed on entangled particles can, in some cases, be found to be perfectly [[correlated]]. For example, if a pair of entangled particles is generated such that their total spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a first axis, then the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis, is found to be anticlockwise. However, this behavior gives rise to seemingly [[paradox]]ical effects: any measurement of a particle's properties results in an apparent and irreversible [[wave function collapse]] of that particle and changes the original quantum state. With entangled particles, such measurements affect the entangled system as a whole.

Such phenomena were the subject of a 1935 paper by [[Albert Einstein]], [[Boris Podolsky]], and [[Nathan Rosen]],<ref name="Einstein1935">

Einstein and others considered such behavior impossible, as it violated the [[local realism]] view of causality (Einstein referring to it as "spooky [[action at a distance]]")<ref>Physicist John Bell depicts the Einstein camp in this debate in his article entitled "Bertlmann's socks and the nature of reality", p. 143 of ''Speakable and unspeakable in quantum mechanics'': "For EPR that would be an unthinkable 'spooky action at a distance'. To avoid such action at a distance they have to attribute, to the space-time regions in question, real properties in advance of observation, correlated properties, which predetermine the outcomes of these particular observations. Since these real properties, fixed in advance of observation, are not contained in quantum formalism, that formalism for EPR is incomplete. It may be correct, as far as it goes, but the usual quantum formalism cannot be the whole story." And again on p. 144 Bell says: "Einstein had no difficulty accepting that affairs in different places could be correlated. What he could not accept was that an intervention at one place could influence, immediately, affairs at the other."

According to ''some'' [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]], the effect of one measurement occurs instantly. Other interpretations which do not recognize [[wavefunction collapse]] dispute that there is any "effect" at all.

In 1935, [[Albert Einstein]], [[Boris Podolsky]] and [[Nathan Rosen]] published a paper on the counterintuitive predictions that quantum mechanics makes for pairs of objects prepared together in a particular way.<ref name="Einstein1935" /> In this study, the three formulated the [[Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox]] (EPR paradox), a [[thought experiment]] that attempted to show that "the [[quantum-mechanical]] description of physical reality given by wave functions is not complete."<ref name="Einstein1935" /> However, the three scientists did not coin the word ''entanglement'', nor did they generalize the special properties of the [[quantum state]] they considered. Following the EPR paper, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] wrote a letter to Einstein in [[German language|German]] in which he used the word ''Verschränkung'' (translated by himself as ''entanglement'') "to describe the correlations between two particles that interact and then separate, as in the EPR experiment."<ref name=MK>Kumar, M., ''Quantum'', Icon Books, 2009, p. 313.</ref> However, Schrödinger had discussed the phenomenon as early as 1932.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Christandl |first=Matthias |date=2006 |title=The Structure of Bipartite Quantum States – Insights from Group Theory and Cryptography |journal= |pages=vi, iv |arxiv=quant-ph/0604183 |bibcode=2006PhDT.......289C }}</ref>

Schrödinger shortly thereafter published a seminal paper defining and discussing the notion of "entanglement." In the paper, he recognized the importance of the concept, and stated:<ref name="Schrödinger1935"/> "I would not call [entanglement] ''one'' but rather ''the'' characteristic trait of quantum mechanics, the one that enforces its entire departure from [[Classical mechanics|classical]] lines of thought." Like Einstein, Schrödinger was dissatisfied with the concept of entanglement, because it seemed to violate the speed limit on the transmission of information implicit in the [[theory of relativity]].<ref>Alisa Bokulich, Gregg Jaeger, ''Philosophy of Quantum Information and Entanglement'', Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. xv.</ref> Einstein later famously derided entanglement as "''spukhafte Fernwirkung''"<ref name="spukhafte">Letter from Einstein to Max Born, 3 March 1947; ''The Born-Einstein Letters; Correspondence between Albert Einstein and Max and Hedwig Born from 1916 to 1955'', Walker, New York, 1971.

The EPR paper generated significant interest among physicists, which inspired much discussion about the foundations of quantum mechanics and [[De Broglie–Bohm theory|Bohm's interpretation]] in particular, but produced relatively little other published work. Despite the interest, the weak point in EPR's argument was not discovered until 1964, when [[John Stewart Bell]] proved that one of their key assumptions, the [[principle of locality]], as applied to the kind of hidden variables interpretation hoped for by EPR, was mathematically inconsistent with the predictions of quantum theory.

Specifically, Bell demonstrated an upper limit, seen in [[Bell's inequality]], regarding the strength of correlations that can be produced in any theory obeying [[local realism]], and showed that quantum theory predicts violations of this limit for certain entangled systems.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bell |first=J.

An early experimental breakthrough was due to Carl Kocher,<ref name="Kocher1" /><ref name="Kocherphd" /> who already in 1967 presented an apparatus in which two photons successively emitted from a calcium atom were shown to be entangled – the first case of entangled visible light. The two photons passed diametrically positioned parallel polarizers with higher probability than classically predicted but with correlations in quantitative agreement with quantum mechanical calculations. He also showed that the correlation varied as the squared [[Sine and cosine|cosine]] of the angle between the polarizer settings<ref name="Kocherphd" /> and decreased exponentially with time lag between emitted photons.<ref name="Kocher2">{{cite journal |last1=Kocher |first1=C.

For decades, each had left open at least one [[Loopholes in Bell tests|loophole]] by which it was possible to question the validity of the results. However, in 2015 an experiment was performed that simultaneously closed both the detection and locality loopholes, and was heralded as "loophole-free"; this experiment ruled out a large class of local realism theories with certainty.<ref name="hanson">{{cite journal|last1=Hanson|first1=Ronald|title=Loophole-free Bell inequality violation using electron spins separated by 1.3 kilometres|journal=Nature|volume=526|issue=7575|pages=682–686|doi=10.1038/nature15759|arxiv=1508.05949|bibcode = 2015Natur.526..682H|pmid=26503041|year=2015|s2cid=205246446}}</ref> Aspect writes that "... no experiment ... can be said to be totally loophole-free," but he says the experiments "remove the last doubts that we should renounce" local hidden variables, and refers to examples of remaining loopholes as being "far fetched" and "foreign to the usual way of reasoning in physics."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Aspect |first=Alain |date=16 December 2015 |title=Closing the Door on Einstein and Bohr's Quantum Debate |journal=[[Physics (magazine)|Physics]] |volume=8 |pages=123 |bibcode=2015PhyOJ...8..123A |doi=10.1103/Physics.8.123 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

Bell's work raised the possibility of using these super-strong correlations as a resource for communication.

== Concept ==

=== Meaning of entanglement ===
An entangled system is defined to be one whose quantum state cannot be factored as a product of states of its local constituents; that is to say, they are not individual particles but are an inseparable whole. In entanglement, one constituent cannot be fully described without considering the other(s). The state of a composite system is always expressible as a sum, or [[quantum superposition|superposition]], of products of states of local constituents; it is entangled if this sum cannot be written as a single product term.

Quantum [[physical system|systems]] can become entangled through various types of interactions. For some ways in which entanglement may be achieved for experimental purposes, see the section below on [[#Methods of creating entanglement|methods]]. Entanglement is broken when the entangled particles [[quantum decoherence|decohere]] through interaction with the environment; for example, when a measurement is made.<ref name="Peres1993">Asher Peres, ''[[Quantum Theory: Concepts and Methods]]'', Kluwer, 1993; {{ISBN|0-7923-2549-4}}, p. 115.</ref>

As an example of entanglement: a [[subatomic particle]] [[Particle decay|decays]] into an entangled pair of other particles. The decay events obey the various [[conservation laws]], and as a result, the measurement outcomes of one daughter particle must be highly correlated with the measurement outcomes of the other daughter particle (so that the total momenta, angular momenta, energy, and so forth remains roughly the same before and after this process). For instance, a [[Spin (physics)|spin]]-zero particle could decay into a pair of spin-1/2 particles. Since the total spin before and after this decay must be zero (conservation of angular momentum), whenever the first particle is measured to be [[Spin (physics)#Direction|spin up]] on some axis, the other, when measured on the same axis, is always found to be [[Spin (physics)#Direction|spin down]]. (This is called the spin anti-correlated case; and if the prior probabilities for measuring each spin are equal, the pair is said to be in the [[singlet state]].)

The above result may or may not be perceived as surprising. A classical system would display the same property, and a [[hidden variable theory]] would certainly be required to do so, based on conservation of angular momentum in classical and quantum mechanics alike. The difference is that a classical system has definite values for all the observables all along, while the quantum system does not. In a sense to be discussed below, the quantum system considered here seems to acquire a probability distribution for the outcome of a measurement of the spin along any axis of the other particle upon measurement of the first particle. This probability distribution is in general different from what it would be without measurement of the first particle. This may certainly be perceived as surprising in the case of spatially separated entangled particles.

===Paradox===
The paradox is that a measurement made on either of the particles apparently collapses the state of the entire entangled system—and does so instantaneously, before any information about the measurement result could have been communicated to the other particle (assuming that information cannot travel [[faster than light]]) and hence assured the "proper" outcome of the measurement of the other part of the entangled pair. In the [[Copenhagen interpretation]], the result of a spin measurement on one of the particles is a collapse (of wave function) into a state in which each particle has a definite spin (either up or down) along the axis of measurement. The outcome is taken to be random, with each possibility having a probability of 50%. However, if both spins are measured along the same axis, they are found to be anti-correlated. This means that the random outcome of the measurement made on one particle seems to have been transmitted to the other, so that it can make the "right choice" when it too is measured.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Anderson |first1=Rupert W. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JxauCQAAQBAJ&q=The+outcome+is+taken+to+be+random,+with+each+possibility+having+a+probability+of+50%25.+However,+if+both+spins+are+measured+along+the+same+axis,+they+are+found+to+be+anti-correlated.+This+means+that+the+random+outcome+of+the+measurement+made+on+one+particle+seems+to+have+been+transmitted+to+the+other,+so+that+it+can+make+the+%22right+choice%22+when+it+too+is+measured&pg=PA100 |title=The Cosmic Compendium: Interstellar Travel |date=28 March 2015 |publisher=The Cosmic Compendium |isbn=9781329022027 |edition=First |page=100}}</ref>

The distance and timing of the measurements can be chosen so as to make the interval between the two measurements [[spacelike]], hence, any causal effect connecting the events would have to travel faster than light. According to the principles of [[special relativity]], it is not possible for any information to travel between two such measuring events. It is not even possible to say which of the measurements came first. For two spacelike separated events {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''x''<sub>2</sub>}} there are [[inertial frame]]s in which {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>}} is first and others in which {{math|''x''<sub>2</sub>}} is first. Therefore, the correlation between the two measurements cannot be explained as one measurement determining the other: different observers would disagree about the role of cause and effect.

(In fact similar paradoxes can arise even without entanglement: the position of a single particle is spread out over space, and two widely separated detectors attempting to detect the particle in two different places must instantaneously attain appropriate correlation, so that they do not both detect the particle.)

=== Hidden variables theory ===
A possible resolution to the paradox is to assume that quantum theory is incomplete, and the result of measurements depends on predetermined "hidden variables".<ref name="Gibney2017">{{cite journal

 | year = 2017
}}</ref> The state of the particles being measured contains some [[hidden-variable theory|hidden variables]], whose values effectively determine, right from the moment of separation, what the outcomes of the spin measurements are going to be. This would mean that each particle carries all the required information with it, and nothing needs to be transmitted from one particle to the other at the time of measurement. Einstein and others (see the previous section) originally believed this was the only way out of the paradox, and the accepted quantum mechanical description (with a random measurement outcome) must be incomplete.

=== Violations of Bell's inequality ===
[[Local hidden-variable theory|Local hidden variable theories]] fail, however, when measurements of the spin of entangled particles along different axes are considered. If a large number of pairs of such measurements are made (on a large number of pairs of entangled particles), then statistically, if the local realist or hidden variables view were correct, the results would always satisfy [[Bell's inequality]]. A [[Bell test experiments|number of experiments]] have shown in practice that Bell's inequality is not satisfied. However, prior to 2015, all of these experiments had loophole problems that were considered the most important by the community of physicists.<ref>{{citation |last1=Gerhardt |first1=I. |title=Experimentally faking the violation of Bell's inequalities |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=107 |issue=17 |page=170404 |year=2011 |arxiv=1106.3224 |bibcode=2011PhRvL.107q0404G |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.170404 |pmid=22107491 |s2cid=16306493 |last2=Liu |first2=Q. |last3=Lamas-Linares |first3=A. |last4=Skaar |first4=J. |last5=Scarani |first5=V. |last6=Makarov |first6=V. |last7=Kurtsiefer |first7=C.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Santos |first1=E. |year=2004 |title=The failure to perform a loophole-free test of Bell's Inequality supports local realism |journal=Foundations of Physics |volume=34 |issue=11 |pages=1643–1673 |bibcode=2004FoPh...34.1643S |doi=10.1007/s10701-004-1308-z |s2cid=123642560}}</ref> When measurements of the entangled particles are made in moving [[special relativity|relativistic]] reference frames, in which each measurement (in its own relativistic time frame) occurs before the other, the measurement results remain correlated.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zbinden |first=H. |author2=Gisin |author3=Tittel |display-authors=1 |year=2001 |title=Experimental test of nonlocal quantum correlations in relativistic configurations |url=http://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:37034 |journal=Phys.

The fundamental issue about measuring spin along different axes is that these measurements cannot have definite values at the same time―they are [[Incompatible observables|incompatible]] in the sense that these measurements' maximum simultaneous precision is constrained by the [[uncertainty principle]]. This is contrary to what is found in classical physics, where any number of properties can be measured simultaneously with arbitrary accuracy. It has been proven mathematically that compatible measurements cannot show Bell-inequality-violating correlations,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cirel'son|first1=B. S.|title=Quantum generalizations of Bell's inequality |journal=Letters in Mathematical Physics |volume=4|issue=2|pages=93–100| year=1980|doi=10.1007/BF00417500|bibcode=1980LMaPh...4...93C |s2cid=120680226}}</ref> and thus entanglement is a fundamentally non-classical phenomenon.
<!--This paragraph is just confusing to me:
Entanglement is required to preserve the [[Uncertainty principle]], as seen in the EPR paradox. For example, say that a high energy photon decays into an electron / positron pair, and the position of the electron and the momentum of the positron are then measured. If we don't allow entanglement in the physical description of the pair, the position and momentum of each particle can still be deduced by reference to the conservation of momentum, violating the Uncertainty principle. Alternatively, if we require the uncertainty principle to hold true, and still disallow entanglement in the physical description of the pair, the uncertainty principle would allow violations in the law of conservation of momentum, because strong correlation in both position and momentum would be impossible (i.e., one would not be able to effectively deduce the position and momentum of the electron because they could not be highly correlated with both the position and momentum of the positron).-->

=== Notable experimental results proving quantum entanglement ===
The first experiment that verified Einstein's ''spooky action at a distance'' (entanglement) was successfully corroborated in a lab by [[Chien-Shiung Wu]] and colleague I. Shaknov in 1949, and was published on New Year's Day in 1950. The result specifically proved the quantum correlations of a pair of photons.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wu |first1=C.

In August 2014, Brazilian researcher Gabriela Barreto Lemos and team were able to "take pictures" of objects using photons that had not interacted with the subjects, but were entangled with photons that did interact with such objects. Lemos, from the University of Vienna, is confident that this new quantum imaging technique could find application where low light imaging is imperative, in fields such as biological or medical imaging.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/news/entangled-photons-make-a-picture-from-a-paradox-1.15781 |title=Entangled photons make a picture from a paradox |journal=Nature |access-date=2014-10-13 |doi=10.1038/nature.2014.15781 |year=2014 |last1=Gibney |first1=Elizabeth |s2cid=124976589|doi-access=free }}</ref>

Since 2016, various companies, for example IBM and Microsoft, have created quantum computers that allowed developers and tech enthusiasts to freely experiment with concepts of quantum mechanics including quantum entanglement.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rozatkar|first=Gaurav|date=2018-08-16|title=Demonstration of quantum entanglement|url=https://osf.io/g8bpj/|journal=OSF|language=en}}</ref>

=== Emergence of time from quantum entanglement ===

There is a fundamental conflict, referred to as the '''problem of time''', between the way the concept of ''time'' is used in [[quantum mechanics]], and the role it plays in [[general relativity]]. In standard quantum theories time acts as an independent background through which states evolve, with the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian operator]] acting as the
[[Translation operator (quantum mechanics)|generator of infinitesimal translations]] of quantum states through time.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Modern Quantum Mechanics|last1=Sakurai|first1=J. J.|last2=Napolitano|first2=Jim J.|date=2010-07-14|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0-8053-8291-4|edition=2|page=68|language=en}}</ref>

In contrast, general relativity [[Einstein field equations|treats time as a dynamical variable]] which relates directly with matter and moreover requires the [[Hamiltonian constraint]] to vanish. In [[Canonical quantum gravity|quantized general relativity]], the quantum version of the Hamiltonian constraint using metric variables, leads to the [[Wheeler–DeWitt equation]]:

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = <math>\hat{H}(x) |\psi\rangle = 0</math>
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

where <math>\hat{H}(x)</math> is the Hamiltonian constraint and <math>|\psi\rangle</math> stands for the [[wave function of the universe]]. The operator <math>\hat{H}</math> acts on the [[Hilbert space]] of wave functions, but it is not the same Hilbert space as in the nonrelativistic case. This Hamiltonian no longer determines the evolution of the system because the [[Schrödinger equation]]: <math>\hat{H} |\psi\rangle = i \hbar {\partial \over {\partial t}} |\psi\rangle </math>, ceases to be valid. This property is known as timelessness. Various attempts to incorporate time in a fully quantum framework have been made, starting with the '''Page and Wootters mechanism''' and other subsequent proposals.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Page |first1=Don N. |last2=Wootters |first2=William K. |date=1983-06-15 |title=Evolution without evolution: Dynamics described by stationary observables |url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.27.2885 |journal=Physical Review D |volume=27 |issue=12 |pages=2885–2892 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.27.2885|bibcode=1983PhRvD..27.2885P }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Rovelli |first=Carlo |date=1990-10-15 |title=Quantum mechanics without time: A model |url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.42.2638 |journal=Physical Review D |volume=42 |issue=8 |pages=2638–2646 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.42.2638|pmid=10013133 |bibcode=1990PhRvD..42.2638R }}</ref>

The [[emergence]] of time was also proposed as arising from quantum correlations between
an evolving system and a reference quantum clock system, the concept of '''system-time entanglement''' is introduced as a quantifier of the actual distinguishable evolution undergone by the system.<ref>{{Cite journal|title= Time from quantum entanglement: an experimental illustration|arxiv=1310.4691|bibcode = 2014PhRvA..89e2122M |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.89.052122|volume=89|issue= 5|pages=052122|journal=Physical Review A|year=2014 | last1 = Moreva | first1 = Ekaterina|s2cid=118638346}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Giovannetti |first1=Vittorio |last2=Lloyd |first2=Seth |last3=Maccone |first3=Lorenzo |date=2015-08-26 |title=Quantum time |url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.92.045033 |journal=Physical Review D |volume=92 |issue=4 |pages=045033 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.92.045033|arxiv=1504.04215 |bibcode=2015PhRvD..92d5033G |hdl=1721.1/98287 |s2cid=85537706 }}</ref>

== Non-locality and entanglement ==
In the media and popular science, [[Quantum nonlocality|quantum non-locality]] is often portrayed as being equivalent to entanglement. While this is true for pure bipartite quantum states, in general entanglement is only necessary for non-local correlations, but there exist mixed entangled states that do not produce such correlations.<ref name="Brunner-RMP2014">{{cite journal

The mentioned proofs about the existence of local models assume that there is only one copy of the quantum state available at a time. If the particles are allowed to perform local measurements on many copies of such states, then many apparently local states (e.g., the qubit Werner states) can no longer be described by a local model. This is, in particular, true for all [[entanglement distillation|distillable]] states. However, it remains an open question whether all entangled states become non-local given sufficiently many copies.<ref name="Vertesi2014">{{cite journal

In short, entanglement of a state shared by two particles is necessary but not sufficient for that state to be non-local. It is important to recognize that entanglement is more commonly viewed as an algebraic concept, noted for being a prerequisite to non-locality as well as to [[quantum teleportation]] and to [[superdense coding]], whereas non-locality is defined according to experimental statistics and is much more involved with the [[Quantum foundations|foundations]] and [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]].<ref>In the literature "non-locality" is sometimes used to characterize concepts that differ from the non-existence of a local hidden variable model, e.g., whether states can be distinguished by local measurements and which can occur also for non-entangled states; see, e.g., {{cite journal |last1=Bennett |first1=Charles H. |last2=DiVincenzo |first2=David P. |last3=Fuchs |first3=Christopher A. |last4=Mor |first4=Tal |last5=Rains |first5=Eric |last6=Shor |first6=Peter W. |last7=Smolin |first7=John A. |last8=Wootters |first8=William K. |year=1999 |title=Quantum nonlocality without entanglement |journal=Phys.

== Quantum-mechanical framework ==
The following subsections are for those with a good working knowledge of the formal, mathematical description of quantum mechanics, including familiarity with the formalism and theoretical framework developed in the articles: [[bra–ket notation]] and [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]].

=== Pure states ===
Consider two arbitrary quantum systems {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}}, with respective [[Hilbert space]]s {{mvar|H<sub>A</sub>}} and {{mvar|H<sub>B</sub>}}. The Hilbert space of the composite system is the [[tensor product]]

: <math> H_A \otimes H_B.</math>

If the first system is in state <math>| \psi \rangle_A</math> and the second in state <math>| \phi \rangle_B</math>, the state of the composite system is

: <math>|\psi\rangle_A \otimes |\phi\rangle_B.</math>

States of the composite system that can be represented in this form are called separable states, or [[product state]]s.

Not all states are separable states (and thus product states). Fix a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] <math> \{|i \rangle_A\}</math> for {{mvar|H<sub>A</sub>}} and a basis <math> \{|j \rangle_B\}</math> for {{mvar|H<sub>B</sub>}}. The most general state in {{math|''H<sub>A</sub>'' ⊗ ''H<sub>B</sub>''}} is of the form

: <math>|\psi\rangle_{AB} = \sum_{i,j} c_{ij} |i\rangle_A \otimes |j\rangle_B</math>.

This state is separable if there exist vectors <math> [c^A_i], [c^B_j]</math> so that <math> c_{ij}= c^A_i c^B_j,</math> yielding <math display="inline"> |\psi\rangle_A = \sum_{i} c^A_{i} |i\rangle_A</math> and <math display="inline"> |\phi\rangle_B = \sum_{j} c^B_{j} |j\rangle_B.</math> It is inseparable if for any vectors <math> [c^A_i],[c^B_j]</math> at least for one pair of coordinates <math> c^A_i,c^B_j</math> we have <math> c_{ij} \neq c^A_ic^B_j.</math> If a state is inseparable, it is called an 'entangled state'.

For example, given two basis vectors <math> \{|0\rangle_A, |1\rangle_A\}</math> of {{mvar|H<sub>A</sub>}} and two basis vectors <math> \{|0\rangle_B, |1\rangle_B\}</math> of {{mvar|H<sub>B</sub>}}, the following is an entangled state:

: <math>\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left ( |0\rangle_A \otimes |1\rangle_B - |1\rangle_A \otimes |0\rangle_B \right ).</math>

If the composite system is in this state, it is impossible to attribute to either system {{mvar|A}} or system {{mvar|B}} a definite [[pure state]]. Another way to say this is that while the [[von Neumann entropy]] of the whole state is zero (as it is for any pure state), the entropy of the subsystems is greater than zero. In this sense, the systems are "entangled". This has specific empirical ramifications for interferometry.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jaeger G, Shimony A, Vaidman L |title=Two Interferometric Complementarities |journal=Phys. Rev. |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=54–67 |year=1995 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.51.54 |pmid=9911555 |bibcode=1995PhRvA..51...54J}}</ref> The above example is one of four [[Bell states]], which are (maximally) entangled pure states (pure states of the {{math|''H<sub>A</sub>'' ⊗ ''H<sub>B</sub>''}} space, but which cannot be separated into pure states of each {{mvar|H<sub>A</sub>}} and {{mvar|H<sub>B</sub>}}).

Now suppose Alice is an observer for system {{mvar|A}}, and Bob is an observer for system {{mvar|B}}. If in the entangled state given above Alice makes a measurement in the <math> \{|0\rangle, |1\rangle\}</math> eigenbasis of {{mvar|A}}, there are two possible outcomes, occurring with equal probability:<ref>{{cite book| last1=Nielsen |first1=Michael A. |last2=Chuang |first2=Isaac L. |year=2000 |title=Quantum Computation and Quantum Information |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |pages=112–113| isbn=978-0-521-63503-5}}</ref>

# Alice measures 0, and the state of the system collapses to <math> |0\rangle_A |1\rangle_B</math>.
# Alice measures 1, and the state of the system collapses to <math> |1\rangle_A |0\rangle_B</math>.

If the former occurs, then any subsequent measurement performed by Bob, in the same basis, will always return 1. If the latter occurs, (Alice measures 1) then Bob's measurement will return 0 with certainty. Thus, system {{mvar|B}} has been altered by Alice performing a local measurement on system {{mvar|A}}. This remains true even if the systems {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} are spatially separated. This is the foundation of the EPR paradox.

The outcome of Alice's measurement is random. Alice cannot decide which state to collapse the composite system into, and therefore cannot transmit information to Bob by acting on her system. Causality is thus preserved, in this particular scheme. For the general argument, see [[no-communication theorem]].

=== Ensembles ===
As mentioned above, a state of a quantum system is given by a unit vector in a Hilbert space. More generally, if one has less information about the system, then one calls it an 'ensemble' and describes it by a [[density matrix]], which is a [[positive-semidefinite matrix]], or a [[trace class]] when the state space is infinite-dimensional, and has trace 1. Again, by the [[spectral theorem]], such a matrix takes the general form:

: <math>\rho = \sum_i w_i |\alpha_i\rangle \langle\alpha_i|,</math>

where the ''w''<sub>i</sub> are positive-valued probabilities (they sum up to 1), the vectors {{mvar| α<sub>i</sub>}} are unit vectors, and in the infinite-dimensional case, we would take the closure of such states in the trace norm. We can interpret {{mvar|ρ}} as representing an ensemble where <math> w_i </math> is the proportion of the ensemble whose states are <math>|\alpha_i\rangle</math>. When a mixed state has rank 1, it therefore describes a 'pure ensemble'. When there is less than total information about the state of a quantum system we need [[#Reduced density matrices|density matrices]] to represent the state.

Experimentally, a mixed ensemble might be realized as follows. Consider a "black box" apparatus that spits [[electron]]s towards an observer. The electrons' Hilbert spaces are [[identical particles|identical]]. The apparatus might produce electrons that are all in the same state; in this case, the electrons received by the observer are then a pure ensemble. However, the apparatus could produce electrons in different states. For example, it could produce two populations of electrons: one with state <math>|\mathbf{z}+\rangle</math> with spins aligned in the positive {{math|'''z'''}} direction, and the other with state <math>|\mathbf{y}-\rangle</math> with spins aligned in the negative {{math|'''y'''}} direction. Generally, this is a mixed ensemble, as there can be any number of populations, each corresponding to a different state.

Following the definition above, for a bipartite composite system, mixed states are just density matrices on {{math|''H<sub>A</sub>'' ⊗ ''H<sub>B</sub>''}}. That is, it has the general form

: <math>\rho =\sum_{i} w_i\left[\sum_{j} \bar{c}_{ij} (|\alpha_{ij}\rangle\otimes|\beta_{ij}\rangle)\right]\left[\sum_k c_{ik} (\langle\alpha_{ik}|\otimes\langle\beta_{ik}|)\right]

where the ''w''<sub>i</sub> are positively valued probabilities, <math display="inline">\sum_j |c_{ij}|^2=1</math>, and the vectors are unit vectors. This is self-adjoint and positive and has trace 1.

Extending the definition of separability from the pure case, we say that a mixed state is separable if it can be written as<ref name=Laloe>{{citation|last=Laloe|first=Franck|year=2001|title=Do We Really Understand Quantum Mechanics|journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=69 |issue=6|pages=655–701 |arxiv=quant-ph/0209123 |bibcode=2001AmJPh..69..655L |doi=10.1119/1.1356698|s2cid=123349369 }}</ref>{{rp|131–132}}

where the {{mvar|w<sub>i</sub>}} are positively valued probabilities and the <math>\rho_i^A</math>'s and <math>\rho_i^B</math>'s are themselves mixed states (density operators) on the subsystems {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} respectively. In other words, a state is separable if it is a probability distribution over uncorrelated states, or product states. By writing the density matrices as sums of pure ensembles and expanding, we may assume without loss of generality that <math>\rho_i^A</math> and <math>\rho_i^B</math> are themselves pure ensembles. A state is then said to be entangled if it is not separable.

In general, finding out whether or not a mixed state is entangled is considered difficult.

=== Reduced density matrices ===
The idea of a reduced density matrix was introduced by [[Paul Dirac]] in 1930.<ref name="Dirac1930">{{cite journal

: <math> |\Psi \rangle \in H_A \otimes H_B. </math>

As indicated above, in general there is no way to associate a pure state to the component system {{mvar|A}}. However, it still is possible to associate a density matrix. Let

: <math>\rho_T = |\Psi\rangle \; \langle\Psi|</math>.

which is the [[projection operator]] onto this state. The state of {{mvar|A}} is the [[partial trace]] of {{mvar|ρ<sub>T</sub>}} over the basis of system {{mvar|B}}:

: <math>\rho_A \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \sum_j^{N_B} \left( I_A \otimes \langle j|_B \right) \left( |\Psi\rangle \langle\Psi| \right)\left( I_A \otimes |j\rangle_B \right) = \hbox{Tr}_B \; \rho_T.</math>

The sum occurs over <math>N_B := \dim(H_B)</math> and <math>I_A</math> the identity operator in <math>H_A</math>. {{mvar|ρ<sub>A</sub>}} is sometimes called the reduced density matrix of {{mvar|ρ}} on subsystem {{mvar|A}}. Colloquially, we "trace out" system {{mvar|B}} to obtain the reduced density matrix on {{mvar|A}}.

For example, the reduced density matrix of {{mvar|A}} for the entangled state

: <math>\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left ( |0\rangle_A \otimes |1\rangle_B - |1\rangle_A \otimes |0\rangle_B \right),</math>

discussed above is

: <math>\rho_A = \tfrac{1}{2} \left ( |0\rangle_A \langle 0|_A + |1\rangle_A \langle 1|_A \right ).</math>

This demonstrates that, as expected, the reduced density matrix for an entangled pure ensemble is a mixed ensemble. Also not surprisingly, the density matrix of {{mvar|A}} for the pure product state <math>|\psi\rangle_A \otimes |\phi\rangle_B</math> discussed above is

: <math>\rho_A = |\psi\rangle_A \langle\psi|_A</math>.

In general, a bipartite pure state ρ is entangled if and only if its reduced states are mixed rather than pure.

=== Two applications that use them ===
Reduced density matrices were explicitly calculated in different spin chains with unique ground state. An example is the one-dimensional [[AKLT Model|AKLT spin chain]]:<ref name="Fan2004">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.227203 | title = Entanglement in a Valence-Bond Solid State | journal = Physical Review Letters | year = 2004 | first = H | last = Fan | page = 227203 |author2=Korepin V |author3=Roychowdhury V | volume = 93 | issue = 22 | pmid = 15601113 |arxiv=quant-ph/0406067 | bibcode=2004PhRvL..93v7203F| s2cid = 28587190 }}</ref> the ground state can be divided into a block and an environment. The reduced density matrix of the block is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to a projector to a degenerate ground state of another Hamiltonian.

The reduced density matrix also was evaluated for [[Heisenberg model (quantum)|XY spin chains]], where it has full rank. It was proved that in the thermodynamic limit, the spectrum of the reduced density matrix of a large block of spins is an exact geometric sequence<ref>{{cite journal| doi=10.1007/s11128-010-0197-7|arxiv=1002.2931|title=Spectrum of the density matrix of a large ''block of'' spins of the XY model in one dimension| year=2010|last1=Franchini|first1=F.|last2=Its|first2=A.

=== Entanglement as a resource ===
In quantum information theory, entangled states are considered a 'resource', i.e., something costly to produce and that allows implementing valuable transformations.<ref name="Chitambar2019">{{cite journal

 }}</ref> The setting in which this perspective is most evident is that of "distant labs", i.e., two quantum systems labeled "A" and "B" on each of which arbitrary [[quantum operation]]s can be performed, but which do not interact with each other quantum mechanically. The only interaction allowed is the exchange of classical information, which combined with the most general local quantum operations gives rise to the class of operations called [[LOCC]] (local operations and classical communication). These operations do not allow the production of entangled states between systems A and B. But if A and B are provided with a supply of entangled states, then these, together with LOCC operations can enable a larger class of transformations. For example, an interaction between a qubit of A and a qubit of B can be realized by first teleporting A's qubit to B, then letting it interact with B's qubit (which is now a LOCC operation, since both qubits are in B's lab) and then teleporting the qubit back to A. Two maximally entangled states of two qubits are used up in this process. Thus entangled states are a resource that enables the realization of quantum interactions (or of quantum channels) in a setting where only LOCC are available, but they are consumed in the process. There are other applications where entanglement can be seen as a resource, e.g., private communication or distinguishing quantum states.<ref name="horodecki2007" />

=== Classification of entanglement ===
Not all quantum states are equally valuable as a resource. To quantify this value, different [[Quantum entanglement#Entanglement measures|entanglement measures]] (see below) can be used, that assign a numerical value to each quantum state. However, it is often interesting to settle for a coarser way to compare quantum states. This gives rise to different classification schemes. Most entanglement classes are defined based on whether states can be converted to other states using LOCC or a subclass of these operations. The smaller the set of allowed operations, the finer the classification. Important examples are:
* If two states can be transformed into each other by a local unitary operation, they are said to be in the same ''LU class''. This is the finest of the usually considered classes. Two states in the same LU class have the same value for entanglement measures and the same value as a resource in the distant-labs setting. There is an infinite number of different LU classes (even in the simplest case of two qubits in a pure state).<ref name="GRB1998">{{cite journal |author1=Grassl, M. |author2=Rötteler, M. |author3=Beth, T. |title=Computing local invariants of quantum-bit systems |journal=Phys.

* If two states can be transformed into each other by local operations including measurements with probability larger than 0, they are said to be in the same 'SLOCC class' ("stochastic LOCC"). Qualitatively, two states <math>\rho_1</math> and <math>\rho_2</math> in the same SLOCC class are equally powerful (since I can transform one into the other and then do whatever it allows me to do), but since the transformations <math>\rho_1\to\rho_2</math> and <math>\rho_2\to\rho_1</math> may succeed with different probability, they are no longer equally valuable. E.g., for two pure qubits there are only two SLOCC classes: the entangled states (which contains both the (maximally entangled) Bell states and weakly entangled states like <math>|00\rangle+0.01|11\rangle</math>) and the separable ones (i.e., product states like <math>|00\rangle</math>).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nielsen |first=M.

* Instead of considering transformations of single copies of a state (like <math>\rho_1\to\rho_2</math>) one can define classes based on the possibility of multi-copy transformations. E.g., there are examples when <math>\rho_1\to\rho_2</math> is impossible by LOCC, but <math>\rho_1\otimes\rho_1\to\rho_2</math> is possible. A very important (and very coarse) classification is based on the property whether it is possible to transform an arbitrarily large number of copies of a state <math>\rho</math> into at least one pure entangled state. States that have this property are called distillable. These states are the most useful quantum states since, given enough of them, they can be transformed (with local operations) into any entangled state and hence allow for all possible uses. It came initially as a surprise that not all entangled states are distillable, those that are not are called '[[Bound entanglement|bound entangled]]'.<ref name="HHH97">{{cite journal |author1=Horodecki, M. |author2=Horodecki, P. |author3=Horodecki, R. |title=Mixed-state entanglement and distillation: Is there a ''bound'' entanglement in nature? |journal=Phys.

A different entanglement classification is based on what the quantum correlations present in a state allow A and B to do: one distinguishes three subsets of entangled states: (1) the ''[[Quantum nonlocality|non-local]] states'', which produce correlations that cannot be explained by a local hidden variable model and thus violate a Bell inequality, (2) the ''[[Quantum steering|steerable]] states'' that contain sufficient correlations for A to modify ("steer") by local measurements the conditional reduced state of B in such a way, that A can prove to B that the state they possess is indeed entangled, and finally (3) those entangled states that are neither non-local nor steerable.

=== Entropy ===
In this section, the entropy of a mixed state is discussed as well as how it can be viewed as a measure of quantum entanglement.

==== Definition ====
[[File:Von Neumann entropy for bipartite system plot.svg|right|thumb|200px|The plot of von Neumann entropy Vs Eigenvalue for a bipartite 2-level pure state. When the eigenvalue has value 0.5, von Neumann entropy is at a maximum, corresponding to maximum entanglement.]]
In classical [[information theory]] {{mvar|H}}, the [[Shannon entropy]], is associated to a probability distribution, <math>p_1, \cdots, p_n</math>, in the following way:<ref name="SE">{{cite web |url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/5516/1/CERpra97b.pdf#page=10 |title=Information-theoretic interpretation of quantum error-correcting codes |first1=Nicolas J. |last1=Cerf |first2=Richard |last2=Cleve }}</ref>

: <math>H(p_1, \cdots, p_n ) = - \sum_i p_i \log_2 p_i.</math>

Since a mixed state {{mvar|ρ}} is a probability distribution over an ensemble, this leads naturally to the definition of the [[von Neumann entropy]]:

: <math>S(\rho) = - \hbox{Tr} \left( \rho \log_2 {\rho} \right).</math>

In general, one uses the [[Borel functional calculus]] to calculate a non-polynomial function such as {{math|log<sub>2</sub>(''ρ'')}}. If the nonnegative operator {{mvar|ρ}} acts on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space and has eigenvalues <math>\lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_n</math>, {{math|log<sub>2</sub>(''ρ'')}} turns out to be nothing more than the operator with the same eigenvectors, but the eigenvalues <math>\log_2(\lambda_1), \cdots, \log_2(\lambda_n)</math>. The Shannon entropy is then:

: <math>S(\rho) = - \hbox{Tr} \left( \rho \log_2 {\rho} \right) = - \sum_i \lambda_i \log_2 \lambda_i</math>.

Since an event of probability 0 should not contribute to the entropy, and given that

:<math> \lim_{p \to 0} p \log p = 0,</math>

the convention {{math|0 log(0) {{=}} 0}} is adopted. This extends to the infinite-dimensional case as well: if {{mvar|ρ}} has [[projection-valued measure|spectral resolution]]

: <math> \rho = \int \lambda d P_{\lambda},</math>

assume the same convention when calculating

: <math> \rho \log_2 \rho = \int \lambda \log_2 \lambda d P_{\lambda}.</math>

As in [[entropy|statistical mechanics]], the more uncertainty (number of microstates) the system should possess, the larger the entropy. For example, the entropy of any pure state is zero, which is unsurprising since there is no uncertainty about a system in a pure state. The entropy of any of the two subsystems of the entangled state discussed above is {{math|log(2)}} (which can be shown to be the maximum entropy for {{math|2 × 2}} mixed states).

==== As a measure of entanglement ====
Entropy provides one tool that can be used to quantify entanglement, although other entanglement measures exist.<ref name="Plenio">{{cite journal|last1=Plenio |first1=Martin B. |first2=Shashank |last2=Virmani|title=An introduction to entanglement measures|year=2007|pages=1–51|volume=1|journal=Quant.

For bipartite pure states, the von Neumann entropy of reduced states is the unique measure of entanglement in the sense that it is the only function on the family of states that satisfies certain axioms required of an entanglement measure.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hill |first1=S |last2=Wootters |first2=W. K. |title=Entanglement of a Pair of Quantum Bits |journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. |arxiv=quant-ph/9703041 |doi =10.1103/PhysRevLett.78.5022 |year=1997 |volume=78 |issue=26 |pages=5022–5025 |bibcode=1997PhRvL..78.5022H |s2cid=9173232 }}</ref>

It is a classical result that the Shannon entropy achieves its maximum at, and only at, the uniform probability distribution {1/''n'',...,1/''n''}. Therefore, a bipartite pure state {{math|''ρ'' ∈ ''H''<sub>A</sub> ⊗ ''H''<sub>B</sub>}} is said to be a '''maximally entangled state''' if the reduced state of each subsystem of {{mvar|ρ}} is the diagonal matrix

: <math>\begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{n}& & \\ & \ddots & \\ & & \frac{1}{n}\end{bmatrix}.</math>

For mixed states, the reduced von Neumann entropy is not the only reasonable entanglement measure.

As an aside, the information-theoretic definition is closely related to [[entropy (statistical views)|entropy]] in the sense of statistical mechanics<ref>{{cite book|first=Asher |last=Peres |title=Quantum Theory: Concepts and Methods |year=1993 |publisher=[[Kluwer]] |isbn=0-7923-2549-4 |oclc=28854083 |pages=260–270 |author-link=Asher Peres |title-link=Quantum Theory: Concepts and Methods}}</ref> (comparing the two definitions in the present context, it is customary to set the [[Boltzmann constant]] {{math|''k'' {{=}} 1}}). For example, by properties of the [[Borel functional calculus]], we see that for any [[unitary operator]] {{mvar|U}},

: <math>S(\rho) = S \left (U \rho U^* \right).</math>

Indeed, without this property, the von Neumann entropy would not be well-defined.

In particular, {{mvar|U}} could be the time evolution operator of the system, i.e.,

: <math>U(t) = \exp \left(\frac{-i H t }{\hbar}\right),</math>

where {{mvar|H}} is the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of the system. Here the entropy is unchanged.

The reversibility of a process is associated with the resulting entropy change, i.e., a process is reversible if, and only if, it leaves the entropy of the system invariant. Therefore, the march of the [[arrow of time]] towards [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] is simply the growing spread of quantum entanglement.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/04/quantum-theory-flow-time/ |title=New Quantum Theory Could Explain the Flow of Time |last1=Wolchover |first1=Natalie |date=25 April 2014 |website=www.wired.com |publisher=Quanta Magazine |access-date=27 April 2014}}</ref> This provides a connection between [[quantum information theory]] and [[thermodynamics]].

[[Rényi entropy]] also can be used as a measure of entanglement.

Nevertheless, on 23 January 2023, physicists reported, that, after all, there is no second law of entanglement manipulation. In the words of the researchers, "no direct counterpart to the second law of thermodynamics can be established".<ref name="NP-20230123">{{cite journal |last1=Lami |first1=Ludovico |last2=Regula |first2=Bartosz |title=No second law of entanglement manipulation after all |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-022-01873-9 |date=23 January 2023 |journal=[[Nature Physics]] |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=184–189 |doi=10.1038/s41567-022-01873-9 |bibcode=2023NatPh..19..184L |s2cid=242757348 |accessdate=17 February 2023 |arxiv=2111.02438 }}</ref>

=== Entanglement measures ===
Entanglement measures quantify the amount of entanglement in a (often viewed as a bipartite) quantum state. As aforementioned, [[entropy of entanglement|entanglement entropy]] is the standard measure of entanglement for pure states (but no longer a measure of entanglement for mixed states). For mixed states, there are some entanglement measures in the literature<ref name="Plenio" /> and no single one is standard.
* Entanglement cost
* [[entanglement distillation|Distillable entanglement]]
* [[Entanglement of formation]]
* [[Concurrence (quantum computing)|Concurrence]]
* [[quantum relative entropy|Relative entropy of entanglement]]
* [[Squashed entanglement]]
* [[Negativity (quantum mechanics)#Logarithmic negativity|Logarithmic negativity]]
Most (but not all) of these entanglement measures reduce for pure states to entanglement entropy, and are difficult ([[NP-hard]]) to compute for mixed states as the dimension of the entangled system grows.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=Yichen|title=Computing quantum discord is NP-complete|journal=New Journal of Physics|date=21 March 2014|volume=16|issue=3|pages=033027|doi=10.1088/1367-2630/16/3/033027|bibcode=2014NJPh...16c3027H|arxiv = 1305.5941 |s2cid=118556793}}</ref>

=== Quantum field theory ===
The [[Reeh-Schlieder theorem]] of [[quantum field theory]] is sometimes seen as an analogue of quantum entanglement.

== Applications ==

Entanglement has many applications in [[quantum information theory]]. With the aid of entanglement, otherwise impossible tasks may be achieved.

=== Entangled states ===
There are several canonical entangled states that appear often in theory and experiments.

For two [[qubits]], the [[Bell state]]s are

: <math>|\Phi^\pm\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle_A \otimes |0\rangle_B \pm |1\rangle_A \otimes |1\rangle_B)</math>
: <math>|\Psi^\pm\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle_A \otimes |1\rangle_B \pm |1\rangle_A \otimes |0\rangle_B).</math>

These four pure states are all maximally entangled (according to the [[entropy of entanglement]]) and form an [[orthonormal]] [[basis (linear algebra)]] of the Hilbert space of the two qubits. They play a fundamental role in [[Bell's theorem]].

For M>2 qubits, the [[Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger state|GHZ state]] is

: <math>|\mathrm{GHZ}\rangle = \frac{|0\rangle^{\otimes M} + |1\rangle^{\otimes M}}{\sqrt{2}},</math>

which reduces to the Bell state <math>|\Phi^+\rangle</math> for <math>M=2</math>. The traditional GHZ state was defined for <math>M=3</math>. &nbsp;GHz states are occasionally extended to [[qudit]]s, i.e., systems of ''d'' rather than 2 dimensions.

Also for M>2 qubits, there are [[Spin squeezing|spin squeezed states]], a class of [[squeezed coherent states]] satisfying certain restrictions on the uncertainty of spin measurements, which are necessarily entangled.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kitagawa |first1=Masahiro |last2=Ueda |first2=Masahito |year=1993 |title=Squeezed Spin States |url=https://ir.library.osaka-u.ac.jp/repo/ouka/all/77656/PhysRevA_47_06_005138.pdf |journal=Physical Review A |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=5138–5143 |bibcode=1993PhRvA..47.5138K |doi=10.1103/physreva.47.5138 |pmid=9909547 |hdl-access=free |hdl=11094/77656}}</ref> Spin squeezed states are good candidates for enhancing precision measurements using quantum entanglement.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wineland |first1=D. J. |last2=Bollinger |first2=J. J. |last3=Itano |first3=W. M. |last4=Moore |first4=F. L. |last5=Heinzen |first5=D.

For two [[boson]]ic modes, a [[NOON state]] is

: <math>|\psi_\text{NOON} \rangle = \frac{|N \rangle_a |0\rangle_b + |{0}\rangle_a |{N}\rangle_b}{\sqrt{2}}, \, </math>

This is like the Bell state <math>|\Psi^+\rangle</math> except the basis kets 0 and 1 have been replaced with "the ''N'' photons are in one mode" and "the ''N'' photons are in the other mode".

Finally, there also exist [[twin Fock states]] for bosonic modes, which can be created by feeding a [[Fock state]] into two arms leading to a beam splitter. They are the sum of multiple of NOON states, and can be used to achieve the Heisenberg limit.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.71.1355|pmid = 10055519|title = Interferometric detection of optical phase shifts at the Heisenberg limit|journal = Physical Review Letters|volume = 71|issue = 9|pages = 1355–1358|year = 1993|last1 = Holland|first1 = M. J|last2 = Burnett|first2 = K|bibcode = 1993PhRvL..71.1355H}}</ref>

For the appropriately chosen measures of entanglement, Bell, GHZ, and NOON states are maximally entangled while spin squeezed and twin Fock states are only partially entangled. The partially entangled states are generally easier to prepare experimentally.

=== Methods of creating entanglement ===
Entanglement is usually created by direct interactions between subatomic particles. These interactions can take numerous forms. One of the most commonly used methods is [[spontaneous parametric down-conversion]] to generate a pair of photons entangled in polarization.<ref name="horodecki2007">{{cite journal

=== Testing a system for entanglement ===

A density matrix ρ is called separable if it can be written as a convex sum of product states, namely
<math display="block">{\rho=\sum_j p_j \rho_j^{(A)}\otimes\rho_j^{(B)}}</math>
with <math>0\le p_j\le 1</math> probabilities. By definition, a state is entangled if it is not separable.

For 2-Qubit and Qubit-Qutrit systems (2&nbsp;×&nbsp;2 and 2&nbsp;×&nbsp;3 respectively) the simple [[Peres–Horodecki criterion]] provides both a necessary and a sufficient criterion for separability, and thus—inadvertently—for detecting entanglement. However, for the general case, the criterion is merely a necessary one for separability, as the problem becomes NP-hard when generalized.<ref name="NP-hard1">Gurvits, L., Classical deterministic complexity of Edmonds' problem and quantum entanglement, in Proceedings of the 35th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, ACM Press, New York, 2003.</ref><ref name="NP-hard2">{{cite journal |author=Gharibian |first=Sevag |year=2010 |title=Strong NP-Hardness of the Quantum Separability Problem |journal=Quantum Information and Computation |volume=10 |pages=343–360 |arxiv=0810.4507 |doi=10.26421/QIC10.3-4-11 |s2cid=621887 |number=3&4}}</ref> Other separability criteria include (but not limited to) the [[range criterion]], [[reduction criterion]], and those based on uncertainty relations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hofmann |first1=Holger F. |last2=Takeuchi |first2=Shigeki |title=Violation of local uncertainty relations as a signature of entanglement |journal=Physical Review A |date=22 September 2003 |volume=68 |issue=3 |page=032103 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.68.032103 |arxiv=quant-ph/0212090 |bibcode=2003PhRvA..68c2103H |s2cid=54893300 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gühne |first1=Otfried |title=Characterizing Entanglement via Uncertainty Relations |journal=Physical Review Letters |date=18 March 2004 |volume=92 |issue=11 |page=117903 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.117903|pmid=15089173 |arxiv=quant-ph/0306194 |bibcode=2004PhRvL..92k7903G |s2cid=5696147 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gühne |first1=Otfried |last2=Lewenstein |first2=Maciej |title=Entropic uncertainty relations and entanglement |journal=Physical Review A |date=24 August 2004 |volume=70 |issue=2 |page=022316 |arxiv=quant-ph/0403219 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.70.022316 |bibcode=2004PhRvA..70b2316G |s2cid=118952931}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Huang |first1=Yichen |title=Entanglement criteria via concave-function uncertainty relations |journal=Physical Review A |date=29 July 2010 |volume=82 |issue=1 |page=012335 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.82.012335 |bibcode=2010PhRvA..82a2335H }}</ref> See Ref.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gühne|first1=Otfried|last2=Tóth|first2=Géza| title=Entanglement detection |journal=Physics Reports|volume=474|issue=1–6|pages=1–75|doi=10.1016/j.physrep.2009.02.004|arxiv=0811.2803 |bibcode=2009PhR...474....1G |year=2009|s2cid=119288569}}</ref> for a review of separability criteria in discrete-variable systems and Ref.<ref name=FriisEtAl2019entanglement>{{Cite journal|last1= Friis |first1=Nicolai |last2= Vitagliano |first2=Giuseppe |last3=Malik |first3=Mehul |last4=Huber |first4=Marcus |date=2019 |title=Entanglement certification from theory to experiment |journal=Nature Reviews Physics |language=en|volume=1|issue=|pages=72–87|doi=10.1038/s42254-018-0003-5 |issn=2522-5820 |arxiv=1906.10929 |s2cid=125658647}}</ref> for a review on techniques and challenges in experimental entanglement certification in discrete-variable systems.

Without such a process, the efficient conversion of light into chemical energy cannot be explained.

However, critical follow-up studies question the interpretation of these results and assign the reported signatures of electronic quantum coherence to nuclear dynamics in the chromophores or to the experiments being performed at cryogenic rather than physiological temperatures.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tempelaar |first1=R. |last2=Jansen |first2=T.

=== Entanglement of elements of living systems ===
In October 2018, physicists reported producing quantum entanglement using [[living organism]]s, particularly between photosynthetic molecules within living [[bacteria]] and [[Photon|quantized light]].<ref name="JPC-20181010">{{cite journal |last1=Marletto |first1=C. |last2=Coles |first2=D.

Living organisms (green sulphur bacteria) have been studied as mediators to create quantum entanglement between otherwise non-interacting light modes, showing high entanglement between light and bacterial modes, and to some extent, even entanglement within the bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Krisnanda | first1 = T. | last2 = Marletto | first2 = C. | last3 = Vedral | first3 = V. | last4 = Paternostro | first4 = M. | last5 = Paterek | first5 = T. | year = 2018 | title = Probing quantum features of photosynthetic organisms | journal = npj Quantum Information | volume = 4 | page = 60 | doi = 10.1038/s41534-018-0110-2 | arxiv = 1711.06485 | bibcode = 2018npjQI...4...60K | doi-access = free }}</ref>

In December 2023, physicists, for the first time, report the entanglement of individual molecules, which may have significant applications in quantum computing.<ref name="PHYS-20231207">{{cite news |title=Physicists 'entangle' individual molecules for the first time, hastening possibilities for quantum computing |url=https://phys.org/news/2023-12-physicists-entangle-individual-molecules-hastening.html |date=7 December 2023 |work=[[Phys.org]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20231208152543/https://phys.org/news/2023-12-physicists-entangle-individual-molecules-hastening.html |archivedate=8 December 2023 |accessdate=8 December 2023 }}</ref>
