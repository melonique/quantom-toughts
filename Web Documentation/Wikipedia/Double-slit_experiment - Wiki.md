In [[modern physics]], the '''double-slit experiment''' demonstrates that light and matter can satisfy the seemingly incongruous classical definitions for both waves ''and'' particles. This ambiguity is considered evidence for the fundamentally probabilistic nature of [[quantum mechanics]]. This type of experiment was first performed by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] in 1801, as a demonstration of the wave behavior of visible light.<ref name="The Bakerian lecture">{{cite journal |last= Young |first= Thomas |title= The Bakerian lecture.

The experiment belongs to a general class of "double path" experiments, in which a wave is split into two separate waves (the wave is typically made of many photons and better referred to as a wave front, not to be confused with the wave properties of the individual photon) that later combine into a single wave. Changes in the path-lengths of both waves result in a [[phase shift]], creating an [[interference pattern]]. Another version is the [[Mach–Zehnder interferometer]], which splits the beam with a [[beam splitter]].{{Quantum mechanics |cTopic=Experiments}}

In the basic version of this experiment, a [[Coherence (physics)|coherent light source]], such as a [[laser]] beam, illuminates a plate pierced by two parallel slits, and the light passing through the slits is observed on a screen behind the plate.<ref name="Lederman">{{cite book |last= Lederman |first= Leon M. |author2=Christopher T.

Other atomic-scale entities, such as [[electrons]], are found to exhibit the same behavior when fired towards a double slit.<ref name="Feynman" /> Additionally, the detection of individual discrete impacts is observed to be inherently probabilistic, which is inexplicable using [[classical mechanics]].<ref name="Feynman" />

The experiment can be done with entities much larger than electrons and photons, although it becomes more difficult as size increases. The largest entities for which the double-slit experiment has been performed were [[molecule]]s that each comprised 2000 atoms (whose total mass was 25,000 [[atomic mass units]]).<ref name="Yaakov Y.

The double-slit experiment (and its variations) has become a classic for its clarity in expressing the central puzzles of quantum mechanics. Because it demonstrates the fundamental limitation of the ability of the observer to predict experimental results, [[Richard Feynman]] called it "a phenomenon which is impossible […] to explain in any [[classical mechanics|classical way]], and which has in it the heart of quantum mechanics.  In reality, it contains the only mystery [of quantum mechanics]."<ref name="Feynman" />

==Overview==
[[Image:Single slit and double slit2.jpg|right|350px|thumb|Same double-slit assembly (0.7 mm between slits); in top image, one slit is closed. In the single-slit image, a [[diffraction pattern]] (the faint spots on either side of the main band) forms due to the nonzero width of the slit. This diffraction pattern is also seen in the double-slit image, but with many smaller interference fringes.]]
If light consisted strictly of ordinary or [[Classical mechanics|classical]] particles, and these particles were fired in a straight line through a slit and allowed to strike a screen on the other side, we would expect to see a pattern corresponding to the size and shape of the slit. However, when this "single-slit experiment" is actually performed, the pattern on the screen is a [[diffraction pattern]] in which the light is spread out. The smaller the slit, the greater the angle of spread. The top portion of the image shows the central portion of the pattern formed when a red laser illuminates a slit and, if one looks carefully, two faint side bands. More bands can be seen with a more highly refined apparatus. [[Diffraction]] explains the pattern as being the result of the interference of light waves from the slit.

If one illuminates two parallel slits, the light from the two slits again interferes. Here the interference is a more pronounced pattern with a series of alternating light and dark bands. The width of the bands is a property of the frequency of the illuminating light.<ref>[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] first proposed the use of this effect as an artifact-independent reference standard for [[length]]

[[File:Young diffraction.svg|thumb|Young's drawing of diffraction]]
When [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] (1773–1829) first demonstrated this phenomenon, it indicated that light consists of waves, as the distribution of brightness can be explained by the alternately additive and subtractive interference of [[wavefront]]s.<ref name="Feynman" /> Young's experiment, performed in the early 1800s, played a crucial role in the understanding of the wave theory of light, vanquishing the [[corpuscular theory of light]] proposed by [[Isaac Newton]], which had been the accepted model of light propagation in the 17th and 18th centuries.

However, the later discovery of the [[photoelectric effect]] demonstrated that under different circumstances, light can behave as if it is composed of discrete particles. These seemingly contradictory discoveries made it necessary to go beyond classical physics and take into account the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] nature of light.

Feynman was fond of saying that all of quantum mechanics can be gleaned from carefully thinking through the implications of this single experiment.<ref name="Greene_1999">{{cite book |last= Greene |first= Brian |author-link= Brian Greene |title= The Elegant Universe: Super Strings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory |publisher= W.W.

The [[Englert–Greenberger duality relation]] provides a detailed treatment of the mathematics of double-slit interference in the context of quantum mechanics.

A low-intensity double-slit experiment was first performed by [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor|G. I. Taylor]] in 1909,<ref>{{cite journal |last= Sir Geoffrey |first= Ingram Taylor |author-link= Geoffrey Ingram Taylor |year= 1909 |title= Interference Fringes with Feeble Light |journal= Prof. Cam.

==Variations of the experiment==

===Interference from individual particles===
An important version of this experiment involves single particle detection. Sending coherent particles through a double-slit apparatus one at a time results in single particles being detected as white dots on the screen, as expected. Remarkably, however, an interference pattern emerges when these particles are allowed to build up one by one (see the image below).

This is actually the only way for particles to create the interference pattern in the experiment, as they only interfere with themselves and never with each other even when several particles are sent through the double slit at once (the only exception is when the particles are [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]])<ref>[https://cds.cern.ch/record/1733647/files/vol44-issue6-p011-e.pdf Entangled photons show interference and bilocation]</ref> This demonstrates the [[wave–particle duality]], which states that all matter exhibits both wave and particle properties: The particle is measured as a single pulse at a single position, while the modulus squared of the wave describes the [[Probability amplitude|probability]] of detecting the particle at a specific place on the screen giving a statistical interference pattern.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality |first1=Brian |last1=Greene |publisher= Random House LLC |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-307-42853-0 |page=90 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DNd2K6mxLpIC&pg=PA90}}</ref> This phenomenon has been shown to occur with photons,<ref name="Ananthaswamy">{{cite book

Instead of propagating through free space after the two slits, and hitting any position in an extended screen, in the interferometer the photons can only propagate via two paths, and hit two discrete photodetectors. This makes it possible to describe it via simple linear algebra in dimension 2, rather than differential equations.

A photon emitted by the laser hits the first beam splitter and is then in a superposition between the two possible paths. In the second beam splitter these paths interfere, causing the photon to hit the photodetector on the right with probability one, and the photodetector on the bottom with probability zero. It is interesting to consider what would happen if the photon were definitely in either of paths between the beam splitters. This can be accomplished by blocking one of the paths, or equivalently by detecting the presence of a photon there. In both cases there will be no interference between the paths anymore, and both photodetectors will be hit with probability 1/2. From this we can conclude that the photon does not take one path or another after the first beam splitter, but rather that it is in a genuine quantum superposition of the two paths.<ref name="vedral">{{cite book |first=Vlatko |last=Vedral |title=Introduction to Quantum Information Science |date=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-921570-6 |oclc=442351498 |author-link=Vlatko Vedral}}</ref>

==="Which-way" experiments and the principle of complementarity===
A well-known [[thought experiment]] predicts that if particle detectors are positioned at the slits, showing through which slit a photon goes, the interference pattern will disappear.<ref name="Feynman" /> This which-way experiment illustrates the [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]] principle that photons can behave as either particles or waves, but cannot be observed as both at the same time.<ref>{{cite web

===Delayed choice and quantum eraser variations===
{{Main|Delayed-choice quantum eraser}}
[[File:Wheeler telescopes set-up.svg|alt=Wheeler's Delayed Choice Experiment|thumb|A diagram of Wheeler's delayed choice experiment, showing the principle of determining the path of the photon after it passes through the slit]]
[[Wheeler's delayed-choice experiment]]s demonstrate that extracting "which path" information after a particle passes through the slits can seem to retroactively alter its previous behavior at the slits.

[[Quantum eraser]] experiments demonstrate that wave behavior can be restored by erasing or otherwise making permanently unavailable the "which path" information.

A simple do-it-at-home illustration of the quantum eraser phenomenon was given in an article in ''Scientific American''.<ref name="Hillmer2007">{{cite magazine|last=Hillmer|first=R.|year=2007|title=A do-it-yourself quantum eraser|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/slideshow/a-do-it-yourself-quantum-eraser/|magazine=Scientific American|volume=296|issue=5|pages=90–95|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0507-90|author2-link=Paul Kwiat|author2=Kwiat, P.|access-date=11 January 2016|bibcode = 2007SciAm.296e..90H }}</ref> If one sets polarizers before each slit with their axes orthogonal to each other, the interference pattern will be eliminated.

===Weak measurement===
{{Main|Weak measurement}}
In a highly publicized experiment in 2012, researchers claimed to have identified the path each particle had taken without any adverse effects at all on the interference pattern generated by the particles.<ref>{{cite web|last=Francis|first=Matthew|title=Disentangling the wave–particle duality in the double-slit experiment|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/05/disentangling-the-wave-particle-duality-in-the-double-slit-experiment/|website=Ars Technica|date=21 May 2012}}</ref> In order to do this, they used a setup such that particles coming to the screen were not from a point-like source, but from a source with two intensity maxima.

Weak measurement followed by post-selection did not allow simultaneous position and momentum measurements for each individual particle, but rather allowed measurement of the average trajectory of the particles that arrived at different positions. In other words, the experimenters were creating a statistical map of the full trajectory landscape.<ref name=Svensson2013/>

In 2002, an electron field emission source was used to demonstrate the double-slit experiment. In this experiment, a coherent electron wave was emitted from two closely located emission sites on the needle apex, which acted as double slits, splitting the wave into two coherent electron waves in a vacuum.

Much of the behaviour of light can be modelled using classical wave theory.  The [[Huygens–Fresnel principle]] is one such model; it states that each point on a wavefront generates a secondary wavelet, and that the disturbance at any subsequent point can be found by [[Superposition principle|summing]] the contributions of the individual wavelets at that point. This summation needs to take into account the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] as well as the [[amplitude]] of the individual wavelets. Only the [[Intensity (physics)|intensity]] of a light field can be measured—this is proportional to the square of the amplitude.

In the double-slit experiment, the two slits are illuminated by the quasi-monochromatic light of a single laser.  If the width of the slits is small enough (much less than the wavelength of the laser light), the slits diffract the light into cylindrical waves. These two cylindrical wavefronts are superimposed, and the amplitude, and therefore the intensity, at any point in the combined wavefronts depends on both the magnitude and the phase of the two wavefronts. The difference in phase between the two waves is determined by the difference in the distance travelled by the two waves.

If the viewing distance is large compared with the separation of the slits (the [[far field]]), the phase difference can be found using the geometry shown in the figure below right.  The path difference between two waves travelling at an angle {{math|θ}} is given by:

:<math>d \sin \theta \approx d \theta</math>

Where d is the distance between the two slits. When the two waves are in phase, i.e. the path difference is equal to an integral number of wavelengths, the summed amplitude, and therefore the summed intensity is maximum, and when they are in anti-phase, i.e. the path difference is equal to half a wavelength, one and a half wavelengths, etc., then the two waves cancel and the summed intensity is zero.  This effect is known as [[Interference (optics)|interference]].  The interference fringe maxima occur at angles

:<math>~ d \theta_n = n \lambda,~ n=0,1,2,\ldots</math>

where λ is the [[wavelength]] of the light. The angular spacing of the fringes, {{math|θ<sub>''f''</sub>}}, is given by

:<math> \theta_f \approx \lambda / d </math>

The spacing of the fringes at a distance {{math|''z''}} from the slits is given by

:<math>~w=z \theta_f = z \lambda /d</math>

For example, if two slits are separated by 0.5&nbsp;mm ({{math|''d''}}), and are illuminated with a 0.6 μm wavelength laser ({{math|λ}}), then at a distance of 1 m ({{math|''z''}}), the spacing of the fringes will be 1.2&nbsp;mm.

If the width of the slits {{math|''b''}} is appreciable compared to the wavelength, the [[Fraunhofer diffraction]] equation is needed to determine the intensity of the diffracted light as follows:<ref>Jenkins FA and White HE, Fundamentals of Optics, 1967, McGraw Hill, New York</ref>

:<math>
\begin{align}
I(\theta)
&\propto  \cos^2 \left [{\frac {\pi d \sin \theta}{\lambda}}\right]~\mathrm{sinc}^2 \left [ \frac {\pi b \sin \theta}{\lambda} \right]
\end{align}
</math>

where the [[sinc function]] is defined as sinc(''x'') = sin(''x'')/''x'' for ''x'' ≠ 0, and sinc(0) = 1.

This is illustrated in the figure above, where the first pattern is the diffraction pattern of a single slit, given by the {{math|sinc}} function in this equation, and the second figure shows the combined intensity of the light diffracted from the two slits, where the {{math|cos}} function represents the fine structure, and the coarser structure represents diffraction by the individual slits as described by the {{math|sinc}} function.

Similar calculations for the [[near and far field|near field]] can be made by applying the [[Fresnel diffraction]] equation, which implies that as the plane of observation gets closer to the plane in which the slits are located, the diffraction patterns associated with each slit decrease in size, so that the area in which interference occurs is reduced, and may vanish altogether when there is no overlap in the two diffracted patterns.<ref>Longhurst RS, Physical and Geometrical Optics, 1967, 2nd Edition, Longmans</ref>

==Path-integral formulation==
[[Image:Wiener process 3d.png|thumb|200px|One of an infinite number of equally likely paths used in the Feynman path integral (see also: [[Wiener process]])]]

The double-slit experiment can illustrate the [[path integral formulation]] of quantum mechanics provided by Feynman.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zee |first=Anthony |title=Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell |author-link=Anthony Zee |title-link=Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell |publisher=Princeton University Press |edition=2nd |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-691-14034-6 |pages=2–16}}</ref> The path integral formulation replaces the classical notion of a single, unique trajectory for a system, with a sum over all possible trajectories.  The trajectories are added together by using [[functional integration]].

Each path is considered equally likely, and thus contributes the same amount.  However, the [[phase (waves)|phase]] of this contribution at any given point along the path is determined by the [[action (physics)|action]] along the path:
<math display="block">A_{\text{path}}(x,y,z,t) = e^{i S(x,y,z,t)}</math>

All these contributions are then added together, and the [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the final result is [[Square (algebra)|squared]], to get the probability distribution for the position of a particle:
<math display="block">p(x,y,z,t) \propto \left\vert \int_{\text{all paths}} e^{i S(x,y,z,t)} \right\vert ^2 </math>

As is always the case when calculating [[probability]], the results must then be [[Normalizing constant|normalized]] by imposing:
<math display="block">\iiint_{\text{all space}}p(x,y,z,t)\,dV = 1</math>

The probability distribution of the outcome is the normalized square of the norm of the [[superposition principle|superposition]], over all paths from the point of origin to the final point, of [[wave]]s [[wave propagation|propagating]] [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionally]] to the action along each path.  The differences in the cumulative action along the different paths (and thus the relative phases of the contributions) produces the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference pattern]] observed by the double-slit experiment.  Feynman stressed that his formulation is merely a mathematical description, not an attempt to describe a real process that we can measure.

==Interpretations of the experiment==
Like the [[Schrödinger's cat]] [[thought experiment]], the double-slit experiment is often used to highlight the differences and similarities between the various [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]].

===Copenhagen interpretation===
{{Main|Copenhagen interpretation}}
The [[Copenhagen interpretation]] is a collection of views about the meaning of [[quantum mechanics]], stemming from the work of [[Niels Bohr]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Max Born]], and others. The term "Copenhagen interpretation" was apparently coined by Heisenberg during the 1950s to refer to ideas developed in the 1925–1927 period, glossing over his disagreements with Bohr.<ref name="Faye-Stanford">{{Cite book|last=Faye|first=Jan|title=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|year=2019|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|chapter=Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics|author-link=Jan Faye|chapter-url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-copenhagen/}}</ref><ref name="camilleri2015">{{cite journal|first1=K. |last1=Camilleri |first2=M. |last2=Schlosshauer |title=Niels Bohr as Philosopher of Experiment: Does Decoherence Theory Challenge Bohr's Doctrine of Classical Concepts? |arxiv=1502.06547 |journal=[[Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics]] |volume=49 |pages=73–83 |year=2015 |doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2015.01.005|bibcode=2015SHPMP..49...73C |s2cid=27697360 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Scheibe |first=Erhard |title=The Logical Analysis of Quantum Mechanics |publisher=Pergamon Press |year=1973 |isbn=978-0-08-017158-6 |oclc=799397091 |quote=[T]here is no point in looking for ''the'' Copenhagen interpretation as a unified and consistent logical structure. Terms such as "Copenhagen interpretation" or "Copenhagen school" are based on the history of the development of quantum mechanics; they form a simplified and often convenient way of referring to the ideas of a number of physicists who played an important role in the establishment of quantum mechanics, and who were collaborators of Bohr's at his Institute or took part in the discussions during the crucial years. On closer inspection, one sees quite easily that these ideas are divergent in detail and that in particular the views of Bohr, the spiritual leader of the school, form a separate entity which can now be understood only by a thorough study of as many as possible of the relevant publications by Bohr himself. |author-link=Erhard Scheibe}}</ref><ref name="Mermin 2017">{{Cite book |last=Mermin |first=N.

Features common across versions of the Copenhagen interpretation include the idea that quantum mechanics is intrinsically [[Indeterminism|indeterministic]], with probabilities calculated using the [[Born rule]], and the principle of [[Complementarity (physics)|complementarity]], which states that objects have certain pairs of complementary properties that cannot all be observed or measured simultaneously.<ref>{{cite book|last=Omnès |first=Roland |author-link=Roland Omnès |chapter=The Copenhagen Interpretation |title=Understanding Quantum Mechanics |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1999 |pages=41–54 |doi=10.2307/j.ctv173f2pm.9 |s2cid=203390914 }}</ref> Moreover, the act of "observing" or "measuring" an object is irreversible, and no truth can be attributed to an object, [[counterfactual definiteness|except according to the results of its measurement]].

===Relational interpretation===
According to the [[Relational quantum mechanics|relational interpretation of quantum mechanics]], first proposed by [[Carlo Rovelli]],<ref>{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1007/BF02302261|last = Rovelli|first = Carlo|author-link = Carlo Rovelli|title = Relational Quantum Mechanics|journal = International Journal of Theoretical Physics|volume = 35|issue = 8|pages = 1637–1678|year = 1996|arxiv = quant-ph/9609002 |bibcode = 1996IJTP...35.1637R |s2cid = 16325959}}</ref> observations such as those in the double-slit experiment result specifically from the interaction between the [[Observer (quantum physics)|observer]] (measuring device) and the object being observed (physically interacted with), not any absolute property possessed by the object. In the case of an electron, if it is initially "observed" at a particular slit, then the observer–particle (photon–electron) interaction includes information about the electron's position. This partially constrains the particle's eventual location at the screen. If it is "observed" (measured with a photon) not at a particular slit but rather at the screen, then there is no "which path" information as part of the interaction, so the electron's "observed" position on the screen is determined strictly by its probability function. This makes the resulting pattern on the screen the same as if each individual electron had passed through both slits.{{citation needed|date=September 2023}}

===Many-worlds interpretation===
As with Copenhagen, there are multiple variants of the [[many-worlds interpretation]]. The unifying theme is that physical reality is identified with a wavefunction, and this wavefunction always evolves unitarily, i.e., following the Schrödinger equation with no collapses.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kent|first=Adrian|author-link=Adrian Kent|date=February 2015|title=Does it Make Sense to Speak of Self-Locating Uncertainty in the Universal Wave Function?

[[David Deutsch]] argues that the way to understand the double-slit experiment is that in each universe the particle travels through a specific slit, but its motion is affected by the interference with particles in other universes. This creates the observable fringes.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Deutsch |first=David |url=http://archive.org/details/fabricofreality0000deut |title=The Fabric of Reality |date=1998 |location=London |publisher=Penguin  |isbn=978-0-14-014690-5|pages=40–53}}</ref> David Wallace, another advocate of the many-worlds interpretation, writes that in the familiar setup of the double-slit experiment the two paths are not sufficiently separated for a description in terms of parallel universes to make sense.<ref>{{cite book|first=David |last=Wallace |title=The Emergent Multiverse |page=382 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-954696-1 |year=2012}}</ref>

===De Broglie–Bohm theory===
{{Main|de Broglie–Bohm theory}}
An alternative to the standard understanding of quantum mechanics, the [[De Broglie–Bohm theory]] states that particles also have precise locations at all times, and that their velocities are defined by the wave-function. So while a single particle will travel through one particular slit in the double-slit experiment, the so-called "pilot wave" that influences it will travel through both. The two slit de Broglie-Bohm trajectories were first calculated by Chris Dewdney while working with Chris Philippidis and Basil Hiley at Birkbeck College (London).<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Philippidis|first1=C.|last2=Dewdney|first2=C.|last3=Hiley|first3=B.
