In physics, '''quantum tunnelling''', '''barrier penetration''', or simply '''tunnelling''' is a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] phenomenon in which an object such as an electron or atom passes through a [[potential barrier|potential energy barrier]] that, according to [[classical mechanics]], should not be passable due to the object not having sufficient energy to pass or surmount the barrier.

Tunneling is a consequence of the [[Matter wave|wave nature of matter]], where the quantum [[wave function]] describes the state of a particle or other [[physical system]], and wave equations such as the [[Schrödinger equation]] describe their behavior. The probability of transmission of a [[wave packet]] through a barrier decreases exponentially with the barrier height, the barrier width, and the tunneling particle's mass, so tunneling is seen most prominently in low-mass particles such as [[electron]]s or [[proton]]s tunneling through microscopically narrow barriers. Tunneling is readily detectable with barriers of thickness about 1–3&nbsp;nm or smaller for electrons, and about 0.1&nbsp;nm or smaller for heavier particles such as protons or hydrogen atoms.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lerner|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofph00lern/page/1308|title=Encyclopedia of Physics|last2=Trigg|publisher=VCH|year=1991|isbn=978-0-89573-752-6|edition=2nd|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofph00lern/page/1308 1308]}}</ref> Some sources describe the mere penetration of a wave function into the barrier, without transmission on the other side, as a tunneling effect, such as in tunneling into the walls of a [[finite potential well]].<ref name="Davies 2004">{{cite journal | last=Davies | first=P C W | author-link=Paul Davies | title=Quantum mechanics and the equivalence principle | journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity | volume=21 | issue=11 | date=2004-05-06 | issn=0264-9381 | doi=10.1088/0264-9381/21/11/017 | pages=2761–2772 | quote=But quantum particles are able to tunnel into the classically forbidden region ...| arxiv=quant-ph/0403027 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Fowler |first1=Michael |title=Particle in a Finite Box and Tunneling |url=https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/BethuneCookman_University/B-CU%3ACH-331_Physical_Chemistry_I/CH-331_Text/CH-331_Text/03._The_Schrodinger_Equation_and_a_Particle_In_a_Box/3.09%3A_Particle_in_a_Finite_Box_(and_Tunneling) |website=LibreTexts Chemistry |access-date=4 September 2023 |quote=Tunneling into the barrier (wall) is possible.}}</ref>

== Introduction to the concept ==
[[File:Quantum tunnel effect and its application to the scanning tunneling microscope.ogv|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Animation showing the tunnel effect and its application to an [[Scanning tunnelling microscope|STM]]]]

Quantum tunnelling falls under the domain of [[quantum mechanics]]: the study of what happens at the [[quantum realm|quantum scale]], which [[classical mechanics]] cannot explain. To understand the [[phenomenon]], particles attempting to travel across a [[potential barrier]] can be compared to a ball trying to roll over a hill. Quantum mechanics and classical mechanics differ in their treatment of this scenario. 

Classical mechanics predicts that particles that do not have enough energy to classically surmount a barrier cannot reach the other side. Thus, a ball without sufficient energy to surmount the hill would roll back down. In quantum mechanics, a particle can, with a small probability, ''tunnel'' to the other side, thus crossing the barrier. The reason for this difference comes from treating matter as [[wave–particle duality|having properties of waves and particles]].

=== The tunnelling problem ===
[[File:E14-V20-B1.gif|thumb|A simulation of a wave packet incident on a potential barrier. In relative units, the barrier energy is 20, greater than the mean wave packet energy of 14. A portion of the wave packet passes through the barrier.|alt=]]

The [[wave function]] of a [[physical system]] of particles specifies everything that can be known about the system.<ref>Bjorken and Drell, ''Relativistic Quantum Mechanics'', Mcgraw-Hill College, 1965. p. 2</ref> Therefore, problems in quantum mechanics analyze the system's wave function. Using mathematical formulations, such as the [[Schrödinger equation]], the time evolution of a known wave function can be deduced. The square of the [[absolute value#Complex numbers|absolute value]] of this wave function is directly related to the probability distribution of the particle positions, which describes the probability that the particles would be measured at those positions.

As shown in the animation, a wave packet impinges on the barrier, most of it is reflected and some is transmitted through the barrier. The wave packet becomes more de-localized: it is now on both sides of the barrier and lower in maximum amplitude, but equal in integrated square-magnitude, meaning that the probability the particle is ''somewhere'' remains unity. The wider the barrier and the higher the barrier energy, the lower the probability of tunneling.

Some models of a tunneling barrier, such as the [[rectangular potential barrier|rectangular barrier]]s shown, can be analysed and solved algebraically.<ref name=Messiah>{{Cite book |last=Messiah |first=Albert |url=https://archive.org/details/quantummechanics0000mess/quantummechanics0000mess |title=Quantum Mechanics |date=1966 |publisher=North Holland, John Wiley & Sons |isbn=0486409244 |language=en}}</ref>{{rp|96}} Most problems do not have an algebraic solution, so numerical solutions are used. "[[Semiclassical physics|Semiclassical methods]]" offer approximate solutions that are easier to compute, such as the [[WKB approximation]].

== History ==
The Schrödinger equation was published in 1926. The first person to apply the Schrödinger equation to a problem which involved tunneling between two classically allowed regions through a potential barrier was [[Friedrich Hund]] in a series of articles published in 1927. He studied the solutions of a [[double-well potential]] and discussed [[molecular spectra]].<ref name=":0">{{cite journal |last1=Merzbacher |first1=Eugen |title=The Early History of Quantum Tunneling |url=https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.1510281 |journal=Physics Today |access-date=17 August 2022 |date=August 2002 |volume=55 |issue=8 |pages=44–49 |doi=10.1063/1.1510281 |bibcode=2002PhT....55h..44M |quote=Friedrich Hund ... was the first to make use of quantum mechanical barrier penetration ...}}</ref> [[Leonid Mandelstam]] and [[Mikhail Leontovich]] discovered tunneling independently and published their results in 1928.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=L. |last1=Mandelstam |first2=M. |last2=Leontowitsch |title=Zur Theorie der Schrödingerschen Gleichung |journal=Zeitschrift für Physik |volume=47 |issue= 1–2|pages=131–136 |year=1928 |bibcode = 1928ZPhy...47..131M |doi = 10.1007/BF01391061 |s2cid=125101370 }}</ref>

In 1927, [[Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim|Lothar Nordheim]], assisted by [[Ralph H. Fowler|Ralph Fowler]], published a paper which discussed [[thermionic emission]] and reflection of electrons from metals. He assumed a surface potential barrier which confines the electrons within the metal and showed that the electrons have a finite probability of tunneling through or reflecting from the surface barrier when their energies are close to the barrier energy. Classically, the electron would either transmit or reflect with 100% certainty, depending on its energy. In 1928 [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] published two papers on [[field emission]], ''i.e.'' the emission of electrons induced by strong electric fields. Nordheim and Fowler simplified Oppenheimer's derivation and found values for the emitted currents and [[work function]]s which agreed with experiments.<ref name=":0" />

A great success of the tunnelling theory was the mathematical explanation for [[alpha decay]], which was developed in 1928 by [[George Gamow]] and independently by [[Ronald Wilfred Gurney|Ronald Gurney]] and [[Edward Condon]].<ref>{{cite journal |first1=R.

In the early days of quantum theory, the term ''tunnel effect'' was not used, and the effect was instead referred to as penetration of, or leaking through, a barrier. The German term ''wellenmechanische Tunneleffect'' was used in 1931 by Walter Schottky. The English term ''tunnel effect'' entered the language in 1932 when it was used by Yakov Frenkel in his textbook.<ref name=":0" />

In 1957 [[Leo Esaki]] demonstrated tunneling of electrons over a few nanometer wide barrier in a [[semiconductor]] structure and developed a [[diode]] based on tunnel effect.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Esaki |first=Leo |date=1974-03-22 |title=Long Journey into Tunneling |url=https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.183.4130.1149 |journal=Science |language=en |volume=183 |issue=4130 |pages=1149–1155 |doi=10.1126/science.183.4130.1149 |pmid=17789212 |bibcode=1974Sci...183.1149E |s2cid=44642243 |issn=0036-8075}}</ref> In 1960, following Esaki's work, [[Ivar Giaever]] showed experimentally that tunnelling also took place in [[Superconductivity|superconductors]]. The tunnelling spectrum gave direct evidence of the [[superconducting energy gap]]. In 1962, [[Brian Josephson]] predicted the tunneling of superconducting [[Cooper pair]]s. Esaki, Giaever and Josephson shared the 1973 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for their works on quantum tunneling in solids.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Dardo |first=M.

In 1981, [[Gerd Binnig]] and [[Heinrich Rohrer]] developed a new type of microscope, called [[scanning tunneling microscope]], which is based on tunnelling and is used for imaging [[surface]]s at the [[atom]]ic level. Binnig and Rohrer were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986 for their discovery.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors = Binnig G, Rohrer H |date=1987-07-01 |title=Scanning tunneling microscopy—from birth to adolescence |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=615–625 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.59.615 |bibcode=1987RvMP...59..615B |doi-access=free}}</ref>

== Applications ==
Tunnelling is the cause of some important macroscopic physical phenomena.

=== Solid-state physics ===

==== Electronics ====
Tunnelling is a source of current leakage in [[very-large-scale integration]] (VLSI) electronics and results in a substantial power drain and heating effects that plague such devices. It is considered the lower limit on how microelectronic device elements can be made.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Applications of ''tunneling'' |url=http://psi.phys.wits.ac.za/teaching/Connell/phys284/2005/lecture-02/lecture_02/node13.html |access-date=2023-04-30 |website=psi.phys.wits.ac.za}}</ref> Tunnelling is a fundamental technique used to program the floating gates of [[flash memory]].

==== Cold emission ====
{{Main|Field electron emission}}

Cold emission of [[electrons]] is relevant to [[semiconductor]]s and [[superconductor]] physics. It is similar to [[thermionic emission]], where electrons randomly jump from the surface of a metal to follow a voltage bias because they statistically end up with more energy than the barrier, through random collisions with other particles. When the electric field is very large, the barrier becomes thin enough for electrons to tunnel out of the atomic state, leading to a current that varies approximately exponentially with the electric field.<ref name="Taylor">{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=J.|title=Modern Physics for Scientists and Engineers|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2004|isbn=978-0-13-805715-2|page=479}}</ref> These materials are important for flash memory, vacuum tubes, as well as some electron microscopes.

==== Tunnel junction ====
{{Main|Tunnel junction}}

A simple barrier can be created by separating two conductors with a very thin [[Insulator (electricity)|insulator]]. These are tunnel junctions, the study of which requires understanding quantum tunnelling.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lerner|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofph00lern/page/1308|title=Encyclopedia of Physics|last2=Trigg|publisher=VCH|year=1991|isbn=978-0-89573-752-6|edition=2nd|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofph00lern/page/1308 1308–1309]}}</ref> [[Josephson junction]]s take advantage of quantum tunnelling and superconductivity to create the [[Josephson effect]]. This has applications in precision measurements of voltages and [[magnetic fields]],<ref name="Taylor" /> as well as the [[multijunction solar cell]].

==== Tunnel diode ====
{{Main|Tunnel diode}}

[[File:Rtd seq v3.gif|thumb|upright=1.6|right|A working mechanism of a [[resonant tunnelling diode]] device, based on the phenomenon of quantum tunnelling through the potential barriers]]

[[Diode]]s are electrical [[semiconductor device]]s that allow [[electric current]] flow in one direction more than the other. The device depends on a [[depletion layer]] between [[N-type semiconductor|N-type]] and [[P-type semiconductor]]s to serve its purpose. When these are heavily doped the depletion layer can be thin enough for tunnelling. When a small forward bias is applied, the current due to tunnelling is significant. This has a maximum at the point where the [[voltage bias]] is such that the energy level of the p and n [[conduction band]]s are the same. As the voltage bias is increased, the two conduction bands no longer line up and the diode acts typically.<ref name="Krane">{{cite book|last=Krane|first=Kenneth|url=https://archive.org/details/modernphysics00kran/page/423|title=Modern Physics|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=1983|isbn=978-0-471-07963-7|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/modernphysics00kran/page/423 423]}}</ref>

Because the tunnelling current drops off rapidly, tunnel diodes can be created that have a range of voltages for which current decreases as voltage increases. This peculiar property is used in some applications, such as high speed devices where the characteristic tunnelling probability changes as rapidly as the bias voltage.<ref name="Krane" />

The [[resonant tunnelling diode]] makes use of quantum tunnelling in a very different manner to achieve a similar result. This diode has a resonant voltage for which a current favors a particular voltage, achieved by placing two thin layers with a high energy conductance band near each other. This creates a quantum [[potential well]] that has a discrete lowest [[energy level]]. When this energy level is higher than that of the electrons, no tunnelling occurs and the diode is in reverse bias. Once the two voltage energies align, the electrons flow like an open wire. As the voltage further increases, tunnelling becomes improbable and the diode acts like a normal diode again before a second energy level becomes noticeable.<ref name="Knight">{{cite book|last=Knight|first=R. D.|title=Physics for Scientists and Engineers: With Modern Physics|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2004|isbn=978-0-321-22369-2|page=1311}}</ref>

==== Tunnel field-effect transistors ====
{{Main|Tunnel field-effect transistor}}

A European research project demonstrated [[field effect transistors]] in which the gate (channel) is controlled via quantum tunnelling rather than by thermal injection, reducing gate voltage from ≈1 volt to 0.2 volts and reducing power consumption by up to 100×. If these transistors can be scaled up into [[Vlsi|VLSI chips]], they would improve the performance per power of [[integrated circuit]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ionescu|first1=Adrian M.|last2=Riel|first2=Heike|author2-link=Heike Riel|year=2011|title=Tunnel field-effect transistors as energy-efficient electronic switches |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=479|issue=7373|pages=329–337|bibcode=2011Natur.479..329I|doi=10.1038/nature10679|pmid=22094693|s2cid=4322368}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Vyas|first1=P.

==== Conductivity of crystalline solids ====
While the [[Drude-Lorentz model]] of [[electrical conductivity]] makes excellent predictions about the nature of electrons conducting in metals, it can be furthered by using quantum tunnelling to explain the nature of the electron's collisions.<ref name="Taylor" /> When a free electron wave packet encounters a long array of uniformly spaced [[potential barrier|barriers]], the reflected part of the wave packet interferes uniformly with the transmitted one between all barriers so that 100% transmission becomes possible. The theory predicts that if positively charged nuclei form a perfectly rectangular array, electrons will tunnel through the metal as free electrons, leading to extremely high [[Electrical conductance|conductance]], and that impurities in the metal will disrupt it.<ref name="Taylor" />

==== Scanning tunneling microscope ====
{{Main|Scanning tunnelling microscope}}

The scanning tunnelling microscope (STM), invented by [[Gerd Binnig]] and [[Heinrich Rohrer]], may allow imaging of individual atoms on the surface of a material.<ref name="Taylor" /> It operates by taking advantage of the relationship between quantum tunnelling with distance. When the tip of the STM's needle is brought close to a conduction surface that has a voltage bias, measuring the current of electrons that are tunnelling between the needle and the surface reveals the distance between the needle and the surface. By using [[Piezoelectric sensor|piezoelectric rods]] that change in size when voltage is applied, the height of the tip can be adjusted to keep the tunnelling current constant. The time-varying voltages that are applied to these rods can be recorded and used to image the surface of the conductor.<ref name="Taylor" /> STMs are accurate to 0.001&nbsp;nm, or about 1% of atomic diameter.<ref name="Knight" />

=== Nuclear physics ===
==== Nuclear fusion ====
{{Main|Nuclear fusion}}

Quantum tunnelling is an essential phenomenon for nuclear fusion. The temperature in [[stellar core]]s is generally insufficient to allow atomic nuclei to overcome the [[Coulomb barrier]] and achieve [[thermonuclear fusion]]. Quantum tunnelling increases the probability of penetrating this barrier. Though this probability is still low, the extremely large number of nuclei in the core of a star is sufficient to sustain a steady fusion reaction.<ref name="Trixler2013">{{cite journal |last=Trixler |first=F. |date=2013 |title=Quantum tunnelling to the origin and evolution of life |journal=Current Organic Chemistry |volume=17 |pages=1758–1770 |doi=10.2174/13852728113179990083 |pmc=3768233 |pmid=24039543 |number=16}}</ref>

==== Radioactive decay ====
{{Main|Radioactive decay}}

Radioactive decay is the process of emission of particles and energy from the unstable nucleus of an atom to form a stable product. This is done via the tunnelling of a particle out of the nucleus (an electron tunneling into the nucleus is [[electron capture]]). This was the first application of quantum tunnelling. Radioactive decay is a relevant issue for [[astrobiology]] as this consequence of quantum tunnelling creates a constant energy source over a large time interval for environments outside the [[circumstellar habitable zone]] where insolation would not be possible ([[Planetary oceanography#Extraterrestrial water oceans|subsurface oceans]]) or effective.<ref name="Trixler2013" />

Quantum tunnelling may be one of the mechanisms of hypothetical [[proton decay]].<ref name="url[nucl-th/9809006] Time-dependent properties of proton decay from crossing single-particle metastable states in deformed nuclei">{{cite journal |title=Time-dependent properties of proton decay from crossing single-particle metastable states in deformed nuclei |year=1998 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.58.3280 |arxiv=nucl-th/9809006 |last1=Talou |first1=P. |last2=Carjan |first2=N. |last3=Strottman |first3=D. |journal=Physical Review C |volume=58 |issue=6 |pages=3280–3285 |bibcode=1998PhRvC..58.3280T |s2cid=119075457 }}</ref><ref name="urladsabs.harvard.edu">{{cite web |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1982ApJ...252....1D |title=adsabs.harvard.edu |format= |accessdate=}}</ref>

=== Chemistry ===
==== Kinetic isotope effect ====
{{Main|Kinetic isotope effect}}

In [[chemical kinetics]], the substitution of a light [[isotope]] of an element with a heavier one typically results in a slower reaction rate. This is generally attributed to differences in the zero-point vibrational energies for chemical bonds containing the lighter and heavier isotopes and is generally modeled using [[transition state theory]]. However, in certain cases, large isotopic effects are observed that cannot be accounted for by a semi-classical treatment, and quantum tunnelling is required. [[Ronnie Bell|R. P. Bell]] developed a modified treatment of Arrhenius kinetics that is commonly used to model this phenomenon.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bell |first=Ronald Percy |title=The tunnel effect in chemistry |date=1980 |publisher=Chapman and Hall |isbn=0412213400 |location=London |oclc=6854792}}</ref>

==== Astrochemistry in interstellar clouds ====
By including quantum tunnelling, the [[Astrochemistry|astrochemical]] syntheses of various molecules in [[interstellar cloud]]s can be explained, such as the synthesis of [[Hydrogen#Spin isomers|molecular hydrogen]], [[water]] ([[ice]]) and the [[Abiogenesis|prebiotic]] important [[formaldehyde]].<ref name="Trixler2013" /> Tunnelling of molecular hydrogen has been observed in the lab.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Wild |first1=Robert |last2=Nötzold |first2=Markus |last3=Simpson |first3=Malcolm |last4=Tran |first4=Thuy Dung |last5=Wester |first5=Roland |date=2023-03-01 |title=Tunnelling measured in a very slow ion–molecule reaction |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05727-z |journal=Nature |volume=615 |issue=7952 |language=en |pages=425–429 |doi=10.1038/s41586-023-05727-z |pmid=36859549 |arxiv=2303.14948 |bibcode=2023Natur.615..425W |s2cid=257282176 |issn=1476-4687}}</ref>

Spontaneous mutation occurs when normal DNA replication takes place after a particularly significant proton has tunnelled.<ref>{{cite book |last=Matta |first=Cherif F. |title=Quantum Biochemistry: Electronic Structure and Biological Activity |location=Weinheim |publisher=Wiley-VCH |year=2014 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a4JhVFaUOjgC |isbn=978-3-527-62922-0 }}</ref> A hydrogen bond joins DNA base pairs. A double well potential along a hydrogen bond separates a potential energy barrier. It is believed that the double well potential is asymmetric, with one well deeper than the other such that the proton normally rests in the deeper well.

[[File:TunnelEffektKling1.png|thumb|Quantum tunnelling through a barrier. The energy of the tunnelled particle is the same but the probability amplitude is decreased.|alt=]]

=== The Schrödinger equation ===
The [[Schrödinger equation#Time independent equation 2|time-independent Schrödinger equation]] for one particle in one [[dimension]] can be written as
<math display="block">-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2} \Psi(x) + V(x) \Psi(x) = E \Psi(x)</math>
or
<math display="block">\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \Psi(x) = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \left( V(x) - E \right) \Psi(x) \equiv \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} M(x) \Psi(x) ,</math>

where
* <math>\hbar </math> is the reduced [[Planck's constant]],
* ''m'' is the particle mass,
* ''x'' represents distance measured in the direction of motion of the particle,
* Ψ is the Schrödinger wave function,
* ''V'' is the [[potential energy]] of the particle (measured relative to any convenient reference level),
* ''E'' is the energy of the particle that is associated with motion in the ''x''-axis (measured relative to ''V''),
* ''M''(''x'') is a quantity defined by ''V''(''x'') − ''E'' which has no accepted name in physics.

The solutions of the Schrödinger equation take different forms for different values of ''x'', depending on whether ''M''(''x'') is positive or negative. When ''M''(''x'') is constant and negative, then the Schrödinger equation can be written in the form
<math display="block">\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \Psi(x) = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} M(x) \Psi(x) = -k^2 \Psi(x), \qquad \text{where} \quad k^2=- \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} M. </math>

The solutions of this equation represent travelling waves, with phase-constant +''k'' or -''k''. Alternatively, if ''M''(''x'') is constant and positive, then the Schrödinger equation can be written in the form
<math display="block">\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \Psi(x) = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} M(x) \Psi(x) = {\kappa}^2 \Psi(x), \qquad \text{where} \quad {\kappa}^2= \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} M. </math>

The solutions of this equation are rising and falling exponentials in the form of [[evanescent wave]]s. When ''M''(''x'') varies with position, the same difference in behaviour occurs, depending on whether M(x) is negative or positive. It follows that the sign of ''M''(''x'') determines the nature of the medium, with negative M(x) corresponding to medium A and positive ''M''(''x'') corresponding to medium B. It thus follows that evanescent wave coupling can occur if a region of positive ''M''(''x'') is sandwiched between two regions of negative ''M''(''x''), hence creating a potential barrier.

The mathematics of dealing with the situation where ''M''(''x'') varies with ''x'' is difficult, except in special cases that usually do not correspond to physical reality. A full mathematical treatment appears in the 1965 monograph by Fröman and Fröman. Their ideas have not been incorporated into physics textbooks, but their corrections have little quantitative effect.

=== The WKB approximation ===
{{Main|WKB approximation}}

The wave function is expressed as the exponential of a function:

<math display="block">\Psi(x) = e^{\Phi(x)},</math> where <math display="block">\Phi''(x) + \Phi'(x)^2 = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \left( V(x) - E \right).</math>

<math>\Phi'(x)</math> is then separated into real and imaginary parts:

<math display="block">\Phi'(x) = A(x) + i B(x),</math> where ''A''(''x'') and ''B''(''x'') are real-valued functions.

Substituting the second equation into the first and using the fact that the real part needs to be 0 results in:

<math display="block">A'(x) + A(x)^2 - B(x)^2 = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \left( V(x) - E \right).</math>[[File:Wigner function for tunnelling.ogv|upright=1.2|thumb|Quantum tunneling in the [[phase space formulation]] of quantum mechanics. [[Wigner quasiprobability distribution|Wigner function]] for tunneling through the potential barrier <math>U(x) = 8e^{-0.25 x^2}</math> in atomic units (a.u.). The solid lines represent the [[level set]] of the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] <math>H(x,p) = p^2 / 2 + U(x) </math>.]]

To solve this equation using the semiclassical approximation, each function must be expanded as a [[power series]] in <math>\hbar</math>. From the equations, the power series must start with at least an order of <math>\hbar^{-1}</math> to satisfy the real part of the equation; for a good classical limit starting with the highest power of [[Planck's constant]] possible is preferable, which leads to
<math display="block">A(x) = \frac{1}{\hbar} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \hbar^k A_k(x)</math>
and
<math display="block">B(x) = \frac{1}{\hbar} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \hbar^k B_k(x),</math>
with the following constraints on the lowest order terms,
<math display="block">A_0(x)^2 - B_0(x)^2 = 2m \left( V(x) - E \right)</math>
and
<math display="block">A_0(x) B_0(x) = 0.</math>

At this point two extreme cases can be considered.

'''Case 1'''

If the amplitude varies slowly as compared to the phase <math>A_0(x) = 0</math> and
<math display="block">B_0(x) = \pm \sqrt{ 2m \left( E - V(x) \right) }</math>
which corresponds to classical motion. Resolving the next order of expansion yields
<math display="block">\Psi(x) \approx C \frac{ e^{i \int dx \sqrt{\frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \left( E - V(x) \right)} + \theta} }{\sqrt[4]{\frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \left( E - V(x) \right)}}</math>

'''Case 2'''

If the phase varies slowly as compared to the amplitude, <math>B_0(x) = 0</math> and
<math display="block">A_0(x) = \pm \sqrt{ 2m \left( V(x) - E \right) }</math>
which corresponds to tunneling. Resolving the next order of the expansion yields
<math display="block">\Psi(x) \approx \frac{ C_{+} e^{+\int dx \sqrt{\frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \left( V(x) - E \right)}} + C_{-} e^{-\int dx \sqrt{\frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \left( V(x) - E \right)}}}{\sqrt[4]{\frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \left( V(x) - E \right)}}</math>

In both cases it is apparent from the denominator that both these approximate solutions are bad near the classical turning points <math>E = V(x)</math>. Away from the potential hill, the particle acts similar to a free and oscillating wave; beneath the potential hill, the particle undergoes exponential changes in amplitude. By considering the behaviour at these limits and classical turning points a global solution can be made.

To start, a classical turning point, <math>x_1</math> is chosen and <math>\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\left(V(x)-E\right)</math> is expanded in a power series about <math>x_1</math>:

<math display="block">\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\left(V(x)-E\right) = v_1 (x - x_1) + v_2 (x - x_1)^2 + \cdots</math>

Keeping only the first order term ensures linearity:
<math display="block">\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\left(V(x)-E\right) = v_1 (x - x_1).</math>

Using this approximation, the equation near <math>x_1</math> becomes a [[differential equation]]:
<math display="block">\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \Psi(x) = v_1 (x - x_1) \Psi(x).</math>

This can be solved using [[Airy function]]s as solutions.

<math display="block">\Psi(x) = C_A Ai\left( \sqrt[3]{v_1} (x - x_1) \right) + C_B Bi\left( \sqrt[3]{v_1} (x - x_1) \right)</math>

Taking these solutions for all classical turning points, a global solution can be formed that links the limiting solutions. Given the two coefficients on one side of a classical turning point, the two coefficients on the other side of a classical turning point can be determined by using this local solution to connect them.

Hence, the Airy function solutions will asymptote into sine, cosine and exponential functions in the proper limits. The relationships between <math>C,\theta</math> and <math>C_{+},C_{-}</math> are

<math display="block">C_{+} = \frac{1}{2} C \cos{\left(\theta - \frac{\pi}{4}\right)}</math>
and
:[[File:Quantum Tunnelling animation.gif|upright=1.3|thumb|Quantum tunnelling through a barrier. At the origin (''x'' = 0), there is a very high, but narrow potential barrier. A significant tunnelling effect can be seen.|alt=]]<math>C_{-} = - C \sin{\left(\theta - \frac{\pi}{4}\right)}</math>

With the coefficients found, the global solution can be found. Therefore, the [[transmission coefficient (physics)|transmission coefficient]] for a particle tunneling through a single potential barrier is

<math display="block">T(E) = e^{-2\int_{x_1}^{x_2} dx \sqrt{\frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \left[ V(x) - E \right]}},</math>

where <math>x_1,x_2</math> are the two classical turning points for the potential barrier.

For a rectangular barrier, this expression simplifies to:
<math display="block">T(E) = e^{-2\sqrt{\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}(V_0-E)}(x_2-x_1)}.</math>

== Faster than light ==
{{See also|Faster-than-light}}

Some physicists have claimed that it is possible for spin-zero particles to travel faster than the [[speed of light]] when tunnelling.<ref name="Razavy" /> This appears to violate the principle of [[causality (physics)|causality]], since a [[frame of reference]] then exists in which the particle arrives before it has left. In 1998, [[Francis E. Low]] reviewed briefly the phenomenon of zero-time tunnelling.<ref>{{cite journal |first=F. E. |last=Low |title=Comments on apparent superluminal propagation |journal=[[Annalen der Physik|Ann. Phys.]] |volume=7 |issue=7–8 |pages=660–661 |year=1998 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-3889(199812)7:7/8<660::AID-ANDP660>3.0.CO;2-0 |bibcode = 1998AnP...510..660L |s2cid=122717505 }}</ref> More recently, experimental tunnelling time data of [[phonons]], [[photons]], and [[electrons]] was published by [[Günter Nimtz]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=G. |last=Nimtz |title=Tunneling Confronts Special Relativity |journal=[[Foundations of Physics|Found.

Other physicists, such as [[Herbert Winful]],<ref>{{cite journal |first=H. G. |last=Winful |title=Tunneling time, the Hartman effect, and superluminality: A proposed resolution of an old paradox |journal=[[Physics Reports|Phys. Rep.]] |volume=436 |issue=1–2 |pages=1–69 |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.physrep.2006.09.002|bibcode=2006PhR...436....1W }}</ref> disputed these claims. Winful argued that the wave packet of a tunnelling particle propagates locally, so a particle can't tunnel through the barrier non-locally. Winful also argued that the experiments that are purported to show non-local propagation have been misinterpreted. In particular, the group velocity of a wave packet does not measure its speed, but is related to the amount of time the wave packet is stored in the barrier. But the problem remains that the wave function still rises inside the barrier at all points at the same time. In other words, in any region that is inaccessible to measurement, non-local propagation is still mathematically certain.

A 2020 experiment, overseen by [[Aephraim M. Steinberg]], showed that particles should be able to tunnel at apparent speeds faster than light.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://physicsworld.com/a/quantum-tunnelling-time-is-measured-using-ultracold-atoms/ |title=Quantum-tunnelling time is measured using ultracold atoms – Physics World |format= |date=22 July 2020 |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="urlQuanta Magazine">{{cite web |url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-tunnel-shows-particles-can-break-the-speed-of-light-20201020/ |title=Quanta Magazine |format= |date=20 October 2020 |accessdate=}}</ref>

== Dynamical tunneling ==
[[File:Quantum tunneling in phase space.gif|left|thumb|upright=1|Quantum tunneling oscillations of probability in an integrable double well of potential, seen in phase space]]

The concept of quantum tunneling can be extended to situations where there exists a quantum transport between regions that are classically not connected even if there is no associated potential barrier. This phenomenon is known as dynamical tunnelling.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Michael J.|last2=Heller|first2=Eric J.|date=1981-07-01|title=Quantum dynamical tunneling in bound states|url=https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.441832|journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=246–254 |doi=10.1063/1.441832 |bibcode=1981JChPh..75..246D |issn=0021-9606}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Keshavamurthy|first1=Srihari|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c6HMBQAAQBAJ&q=dynamical+tunneling+theory+and+experiment|title=Dynamical Tunneling: Theory and Experiment |last2=Schlagheck |first2=Peter |date=2011-03-09 |publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-1666-0|language=en}}</ref>

=== Tunnelling in phase space ===
The concept of dynamical tunnelling is particularly suited to address the problem of quantum tunnelling in high dimensions (d>1). In the case of an [[integrable system]], where bounded classical trajectories are confined onto [[Torus|tori]] in [[phase space]], tunnelling can be understood as the quantum transport between semi-classical states built on two distinct but symmetric tori.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wilkinson|first=Michael|date=1986-09-01|title=Tunnelling between tori in phase space|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2F0167-2789%2886%2990009-6|journal=Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena|language=en|volume=21|issue=2|pages=341–354|doi=10.1016/0167-2789(86)90009-6|bibcode=1986PhyD...21..341W|issn=0167-2789}}</ref>

=== Chaos-assisted tunnelling ===
[[File:Chaos-assisted tunneling in phase space.gif|left|thumb|upright=1|Chaos-assisted tunnelling oscillations between two regular tori embedded in a chaotic sea, seen in phase space]]

In real life, most systems are not integrable and display various degrees of chaos. Classical dynamics is then said to be mixed and the system phase space is typically composed of islands of regular orbits surrounded by a large sea of chaotic orbits. The existence of the chaotic sea, where transport is classically allowed, between the two symmetric tori then assists the quantum tunnelling between them. This phenomenon is referred as chaos-assisted tunnelling.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Tomsovic|first1=Steven|last2=Ullmo|first2=Denis|date=1994-07-01|title=Chaos-assisted tunneling|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevE.50.145|journal=Physical Review E|volume=50|issue=1|pages=145–162|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.50.145|pmid=9961952|bibcode=1994PhRvE..50..145T}}</ref> and is characterized by sharp resonances of the tunnelling rate when varying any system parameter.

=== Resonance-assisted tunnelling ===
When <math>\hbar</math> is small in front of the size of the regular islands, the fine structure of the classical phase space plays a key role in tunnelling. In particular the two symmetric tori are coupled "via a succession of classically forbidden transitions across nonlinear resonances" surrounding the two islands.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Brodier|first1=Olivier|last2=Schlagheck|first2=Peter|last3=Ullmo|first3=Denis|date=2002-08-25|title=Resonance-Assisted Tunneling|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003491602962810|journal=Annals of Physics|language=en|volume=300|issue=1|pages=88–136|doi=10.1006/aphy.2002.6281|arxiv=nlin/0205054|bibcode=2002AnPhy.300...88B|s2cid=51895893|issn=0003-4916}}</ref>

== Related phenomena ==
Several phenomena have the same behavior as quantum tunnelling, and can be accurately described by tunnelling. Examples include the tunnelling of a classical wave-particle association,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Eddi|first1=A.|last2=Fort|first2=E.|last3=Moisy|first3=F.|last4=Couder|first4=Y.|title=Unpredictable Tunneling of a Classical Wave-Particle Association|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=16 June 2009|volume=102|issue=24|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.240401|url=http://stilton.tnw.utwente.nl/people/eddi/Papers/PhysRevLett_TUNNEL.pdf|access-date=1 May 2016|bibcode=2009PhRvL.102x0401E|pmid=19658983|page=240401|archive-date=10 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310083947/http://stilton.tnw.utwente.nl/people/eddi/Papers/PhysRevLett_TUNNEL.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[evanescent wave coupling]] (the application of [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's wave-equation]] to [[light]]) and the application of the [[wave equation|non-dispersive wave-equation]] from [[acoustics]] applied to [[Wave#Waves on strings|"waves on strings"]]. Evanescent wave coupling, until recently, was only called "tunnelling" in quantum mechanics; now it is used in other contexts.

These effects are modeled similarly to the [[rectangular potential barrier]]. In these cases, one [[transmission medium]] through which the [[wave propagation|wave propagates]] that is the same or nearly the same throughout, and a second medium through which the wave travels differently. This can be described as a thin region of medium B between two regions of medium A. The analysis of a rectangular barrier by means of the Schrödinger equation can be adapted to these other effects provided that the wave equation has [[travelling wave]] solutions in medium A but real [[exponential function|exponential]] solutions in medium B.

In [[optics]], medium A is a vacuum while medium B is glass. In acoustics, medium A may be a liquid or gas and medium B a solid. For both cases, medium A is a region of space where the particle's [[total energy]] is greater than its [[potential energy]] and medium B is the potential barrier. These have an incoming wave and resultant waves in both directions. There can be more mediums and barriers, and the barriers need not be discrete. Approximations are useful in this case.
