{{quantum mechanics}}'''Matter waves''' are a central part of the theory of [[quantum mechanics]], being half of [[wave–particle duality]]. At all scales where measurements have been practical, [[matter]] exhibits [[wave]]-like behavior. For example, a beam of [[electron]]s can be [[diffraction|diffracted]] just like a beam of light or a water wave.

The concept that matter behaves like a wave was proposed by French physicist [[Louis de Broglie]] ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|b|r|ɔɪ}}) in 1924, and so matter waves are also known as '''de Broglie waves'''.

The ''de Broglie wavelength'' is the [[wavelength]], {{math|''λ''}}, associated with a particle with [[momentum]] {{math|''p''}} through the [[Planck constant]], {{math|''h''}}:
<math display="block"> \lambda = \frac{h}{p}.</math>

Wave-like behavior of matter has been experimentally demonstrated, first for electrons in 1927 and for other [[elementary particle]]s, neutral [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s in the years since.

== Introduction ==
=== Background ===
At the end of the 19th century, light was thought to consist of waves of electromagnetic fields which propagated according to [[Maxwell's equations]], while matter was thought to consist of localized particles (see [[wave–particle duality#History|history of wave and particle duality]]). In 1900, this division was questioned when, investigating the theory of [[black-body radiation]], [[Max Planck]] proposed that the thermal energy of oscillating atoms is divided into discrete portions, or quanta.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://physicsworld.com/a/max-planck-the-reluctant-revolutionary/ |title=Max Planck: the reluctant revolutionary |first=Helge |last=Kragh |author-link=Helge Kragh |website=Physics World |date=2000-12-01 |access-date=2023-05-19}}</ref> Extending Planck's investigation in several ways, including its connection with the [[photoelectric effect]], [[Albert Einstein]] proposed in 1905 that light is also propagated and absorbed in quanta,<ref name="WhittakerII">{{cite book | last=Whittaker | first=Sir Edmund | title=A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity | publisher=Courier Dover Publications | date=1989-01-01 | isbn=0-486-26126-3 | volume=2}}</ref>{{rp|87}} now called [[photon]]s. These quanta would have an energy given by the [[Planck–Einstein relation]]:

=== De Broglie hypothesis ===
[[File:Propagation of a de broglie wave.svg|290px|right|thumb|Propagation of '''de Broglie waves''' in one dimension – real part of the [[complex number|complex]] amplitude is blue, imaginary part is green. The probability (shown as the color [[opacity (optics)|opacity]]) of finding the particle at a given point {{math|''x''}} is spread out like a waveform; there is no definite position of the particle. As the amplitude increases above zero the [[slope]] decreases, so the amplitude diminishes again, and vice versa. The result is an alternating amplitude: a wave. Top: [[plane wave]]. Bottom: [[wave packet]].]]

To find the [[wavelength]] equivalent to a moving body, de Broglie<ref name="WhittakerII"/>{{rp|214}} set the [[Energy–momentum relation#Connection to E = mc2|total energy]] from [[special relativity]] for that body equal to {{math | ''h&nu;''}}:
<math display="block">E = \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = h\nu</math>

(Modern physics no longer uses this form of the total energy; the [[energy–momentum relation]] has proven more useful.) De Broglie identified the velocity of the particle, {{math|''v''}}, with the wave [[group velocity]] in free space:
<math display="block"> v_\text{g} \equiv \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial k} = \frac{d\nu}{d(1/\lambda)} </math>

(The modern definition of group velocity uses angular frequency {{mvar|ω}} and wave number {{mvar|k}}). By applying the differentials to the energy equation and identifying the [[Momentum#Relativistic|relativistic momentum]]:
<math display="block"> p = \frac{mv}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} </math>

then integrating, de Broglie arrived as his formula for the relationship between the [[wavelength]], {{mvar|λ}}, associated with an electron and the modulus of its [[momentum]], {{math|''p''}}, through the [[Planck constant]], {{math|''h''}}:<ref>{{cite book |title=Introducing Quantum Theory |author1=McEvoy, J.

=== Schrödinger's (matter) wave equation ===

Following up on de Broglie's ideas, physicist [[Peter Debye]] made an offhand comment that if particles behaved as waves, they should satisfy some sort of wave equation. Inspired by Debye's remark, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] decided to find a proper three-dimensional wave equation for the electron. He was guided by [[William Rowan Hamilton]]'s analogy between mechanics and optics (see [[Hamilton's optico-mechanical analogy]]), encoded in the observation that the zero-wavelength limit of optics resembles a mechanical system – the trajectories of [[light rays]] become sharp tracks that obey [[Fermat's principle]], an analog of the [[principle of least action]].<ref>{{Cite book | last=Schrödinger | first=E. | year=1984 | title=Collected papers | publisher=Friedrich Vieweg und Sohn | isbn=978-3-7001-0573-2}} See the introduction to first 1926 paper.</ref>

In 1926, Schrödinger published the [[Schrödinger equation|wave equation that now bears his name]]<ref name="Schroedinger">{{Cite journal |last=Schrödinger |first=E. |date=1926 |title=An Undulatory Theory of the Mechanics of Atoms and Molecules |url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRev.28.1049 |journal=Physical Review |language=en |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=1049–1070 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.28.1049 |bibcode=1926PhRv...28.1049S |issn=0031-899X}}</ref> – the matter wave analogue of [[Maxwell's equations]] – and used it to derive the [[Emission spectrum|energy spectrum]] of [[hydrogen]]. Frequencies of solutions of the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation differ from de Broglie waves by the [[Compton wavelength|Compton frequency]] since the energy corresponding to the [[Invariant mass|rest mass]] of a particle is not part of the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation. The Schrödinger equation describes the time evolution of a [[wavefunction]], a function that assigns a [[complex number]] to each point in space. Schrödinger tried to interpret the [[modulus squared]] of the wavefunction as a charge density. This approach was, however, unsuccessful.<ref name=Moore1992>{{cite book | last=Moore | first=W.

The following year, 1927, [[Charles Galton Darwin|C. G. Darwin]] (grandson of the [[Charles Darwin|famous biologist]]) explored [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger's equation]] in several idealized scenarios.<ref>Darwin, Charles Galton. "Free motion in the wave mechanics." Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Containing Papers of a Mathematical and Physical Character 117.776 (1927): 258–293.</ref> For an unbound electron in free space he worked out the propagation of the wave, assuming an initial [[Wave packet#Gaussian wave packets in quantum mechanics|Gaussian wave packet]]. Darwin showed that at time <math>t</math> later the position <math>x</math> of the packet traveling at velocity <math>v</math> would be
<math display=block>x_0 + vt \pm \sqrt{\sigma^2 + (ht/2\pi\sigma m)^2}</math>
where <math>\sigma</math> is the uncertainty in the initial position. This position uncertainty creates uncertainty in velocity (the extra second term in the square root) consistent with [[Heisenberg|Heisenberg's]] [[uncertainty relation]] The wave packet spreads out as show in the figure.

Advances in [[laser cooling]] allowed cooling of neutral atoms down to nanokelvin temperatures. At these temperatures, the de Broglie wavelengths come into the micrometre range. Using [[Bragg's law|Bragg diffraction]] of atoms and a Ramsey interferometry technique, the de Broglie wavelength of cold [[sodium]] atoms was explicitly measured and found to be consistent with the temperature measured by a different method.<ref name="Cla">

== Traveling matter waves{{anchor|De Broglie relations}} ==
<!--This section is linked to by [[de Broglie relations]] -->
Waves have more complicated concepts for [[Group velocity|velocity]] than solid objects.
The simplest approach is to focus on the description in terms of plane matter waves for a [[free particle]], that is a wave function described by
<math display="block">\psi (\mathbf{r}) = e^{ i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}-i \omega t },</math>
where <math>\mathbf{r}</math> is a position in real space, <math>\mathbf{k}</math>  is the [[wavevector|wave vector]] in units of inverse meters, {{math|''ω''}} is the [[angular frequency]] with units of inverse time and <math>t</math> is time. (Here the physics definition for the wave vector is used, which is <math>2 \pi</math> times the wave vector used in [[crystallography]], see [[wavevector]].) The de Broglie equations relate the [[wavelength]] {{math|''λ''}} to the modulus of the [[momentum]] <math>|\mathbf{p}| = p</math>, and [[frequency]] {{math|''f''}} to the total energy {{math|''E''}} of a [[free particle]] as written above:<ref name="Resnick 1985">{{cite book |title=Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles |edition=2nd |first1=R. |last1=Resnick |first2=R. |last2=Eisberg |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |date=1985 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-471-87373-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/quantumphysicsof00eisb }}</ref>
<math display="block">\begin{align}
& \lambda = \frac {2 \pi}{|\mathbf{k}|} = \frac{h}{p}\\
& f = \frac{\omega}{2 \pi}= \frac{E}{h}
\end{align}</math>
where {{math|''h''}} is the [[Planck constant]]. The equations can also be written as
<math display="block">\begin{align}
& \mathbf{p} = \hbar \mathbf{k}\\
& E = \hbar \omega ,\\
\end{align}</math>
Here, {{math|1=''ħ'' = ''h''/2''π''}} is the reduced Planck constant. The second equation is also referred to as the [[Planck–Einstein relation]].

=== Group velocity ===
In the de Broglie hypothesis, the velocity of a particle equals the [[group velocity]] of the matter wave.<ref name="WhittakerII" />{{rp|214}}
In isotropic media or a vacuum the [[group velocity]] of a wave is defined by:
<math display="block"> \mathbf{v_g} = \frac{\partial \omega(\mathbf{k})}{\partial \mathbf{k}} </math>
The relationship between the angular frequency and wavevector is called the [[Dispersion relation#De Broglie dispersion relations|dispersion relationship]]. For the non-relativistic case this is:
<math display="block">\omega(\mathbf{k}) \approx \frac{m_0 c^2}{\hbar} + \frac{\hbar k^2}{2m_{0} }\,.</math>
where <math>m_0</math> is the rest mass. Applying the derivative gives the (non-relativistic) '''matter wave group velocity''':
<math display="block">\mathbf{v_g} = \frac{\hbar \mathbf{k}}{m_0}</math>
For comparison, the group velocity of light, with a [[Dispersion relation#Electromagnetic waves in a vacuum|dispersion]] <math>\omega(k)=ck</math>, is the [[speed of light]] <math>c</math>.

As an alternative, using the relativistic [[Dispersion relation#De Broglie dispersion relations|dispersion relationship]] for matter waves
<math display="block"> \omega(\mathbf{k}) = \sqrt{k^2c^2 + \left(\frac{m_0c^2}{\hbar}\right)^2} \,.</math>
then
<math display="block">\mathbf{v_g} = \frac{\mathbf{k}c^2}{\omega} </math>
This relativistic form relates to the phase velocity as discussed below.

For non-isotropic media we use the [[Energy–momentum relation|Energy–momentum]] form instead:
<math display="block">\begin{align}
  \mathbf{v}_\mathrm{g} &= \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial \mathbf{k}} = \frac{\partial (E/\hbar)}{\partial (\mathbf{p} /\hbar)} = \frac{\partial E}{\partial \mathbf{p}} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{p}} \left( \sqrt{p^2c^2+m_0^2c^4} \right)\\
    &= \frac{\mathbf{p} c^2}{\sqrt{p^2c^2 + m_0^2c^4}}\\
    &= \frac{\mathbf{p} c^2}{E} .
\end{align}</math>

But (see below), since the phase velocity is <math>\mathbf{v}_\mathrm{p} = E/\mathbf{p} = c^2/\mathbf{v}</math>, then
<math display="block">\begin{align}
 \mathbf{v}_\mathrm{g} &= \frac{\mathbf{p}c^2}{E}\\
    &= \frac{c^2}{\mathbf{v}_\mathrm{p}}\\
    &= \mathbf{v} ,
\end{align}</math>
where <math>\mathbf{v}</math> is the velocity of the center of mass of the particle, identical to the group velocity.

=== Phase velocity ===
The [[phase velocity]] in isotropic media is defined as:
<math display="block">\mathbf{v_p} = \frac{\omega}{\mathbf{k}}</math>
Using the relativistic group velocity above:<ref name="WhittakerII"/>{{rp|p=215}}
<math display="block">\mathbf{v_p} = \frac{c^2 }{\mathbf{v_g}}</math>
This shows that <math>\mathbf{v_{p}}\cdot \mathbf{v_{g}}=c^2</math> as reported by R.W. Ditchburn in 1948 and J. L. Synge in 1952. Electromagnetic waves also obey  <math>\mathbf{v_{p}}\cdot \mathbf{v_{g}}=c^2</math>, as both <math>|\mathbf{v_p}|=c</math> and <math>|\mathbf{v_g}|=c</math>. Since for matter waves, <math>|\mathbf{v_g}| < c</math>, it follows that <math>|\mathbf{v_p}| > c</math>, but only the group velocity carries information. The [[Faster-than-light|superluminal]] phase velocity therefore does not violate special relativity, as it does not carry information.

For non-isotropic media, then
<math display="block">\mathbf{v}_\mathrm{p} = \frac{\omega}{\mathbf{k}} = \frac{E/\hbar}{\mathbf{p}/\hbar} = \frac{E}{\mathbf{p}}. </math>

Using the [[special relativity|relativistic]] relations for energy and momentum yields
<math display="block">\mathbf{v}_\mathrm{p} = \frac{E}{\mathbf{p}} = \frac{m c^2}{m \mathbf{v}} = \frac{\gamma m_0 c^2}{\gamma m_0 \mathbf{v}} = \frac{c^2}{\mathbf{v}}.</math>
The variable <math>\mathbf{v}</math> can either be interpreted as the speed of the particle or the group velocity of the corresponding matter wave—the two are the same. Since the particle speed <math>|\mathbf{v}| < c </math> for any particle that has nonzero mass (according to [[special relativity]]), the phase velocity of matter waves always exceeds ''c'', i.e.,
<math display="block">| \mathbf{v}_\mathrm{p} | > c ,</math>
which approaches ''c'' when the particle speed is relativistic. The [[Faster-than-light|superluminal]] phase velocity does not violate special relativity, similar to the case above for non-isotropic media. See the article on ''[[Dispersion (optics)#Group velocity dispersion|Dispersion (optics)]]'' for further details.

=== Special relativity ===
Using two formulas from [[special relativity]], one for the relativistic mass energy and one for the [[Momentum#Relativistic|relativistic momentum]]
<math display="block">\begin{align}
E &= m c^2 = \gamma m_0 c^2 \\[1ex]
\mathbf{p} &= m\mathbf{v} = \gamma m_0 \mathbf{v}
\end{align} </math>
allows the equations for de Broglie wavelength and frequency to be written as
<math display="block">\begin{align}
&\lambda =\,\, \frac {h}{\gamma m_0v}\, =\, \frac {h}{m_0v}\,\,\, \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\[2.38ex]
& f = \frac{\gamma\,m_0 c^2}{h} = \frac {m_0 c^2}{h\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} ,
\end{align}</math>
where <math>v=|\mathbf{v}|</math> is the [[velocity]], <math>\gamma</math> the [[Lorentz factor]], and <math>c</math> the [[speed of light]] in vacuum.<ref>{{cite book |title=Stationary states |first=Alan |last=Holden |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1971 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-501497-6 }}</ref><ref>Williams, W.S.C. (2002). ''Introducing Special Relativity'', Taylor & Francis, London, {{ISBN|0-415-27761-2}}, p. 192.</ref> This shows that as the velocity of a particle approaches zero (rest) the de Broglie wavelength approaches infinity.

=== Four-vectors ===
{{Main|Four-vector}}

Using four-vectors, the de Broglie relations form a single equation:
<math display="block">\mathbf{P}= \hbar\mathbf{K} ,</math>
which is [[Inertial frame of reference|frame]]-independent.
Likewise, the relation between group/particle velocity and phase velocity is given in frame-independent form by:
<math display="block">\mathbf{K} = \left(\frac{\omega_0}{c^2}\right)\mathbf{U} ,</math>
where
* [[Four-momentum]] <math>\mathbf{P} = \left(\frac{E}{c}, {\mathbf{p}} \right)</math>
* [[Four-vector#Four-wavevector|Four-wavevector]] <math>\mathbf{K} = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}, {\mathbf{k}} \right) </math>
* [[Four-velocity]] <math>\mathbf{U} = \gamma(c,{\mathbf{u}}) = \gamma(c,v_\mathrm{g} \hat{\mathbf{u}}) </math>

== General matter waves ==
The preceding sections refer specifically to [[free particle]]s for which the wavefunctions are plane waves. There are significant numbers of other matter waves, which can be broadly split into three classes: single-particle matter waves, collective matter waves and standing waves.

=== Single-particle matter waves ===
The more general description of matter waves corresponding to a single particle type (e.g. a single electron or neutron only) would have a form similar to
<math display="block">\psi (\mathbf{r}) = u(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{k})\exp(i\mathbf{k}\cdot \mathbf{r} - iE(\mathbf{k})t/\hbar)</math>
where now there is an additional spatial term <math>u(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{k})</math> in the front, and the energy has been written more generally as a function of the wave vector. The various terms given before still apply, although the energy is no longer always proportional to the wave vector squared. A common approach is to define an [[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] which in general is a tensor <math>m_{ij}^*</math> given by
<math display="block"> {m_{ij}^*}^{-1}  = \frac{1}{\hbar^2} \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial k_i \partial k_j}</math>
so that in the simple case where all directions are the same the form is similar to that of a free wave above.<math display="block">E(\mathbf k) = \frac{\hbar^2 \mathbf k^2}{2 m^*}</math>In general the group velocity would be replaced by the [[probability current]]<ref name=Schiff>{{Cite book |last=Schiff |first=Leonard I. |title=Quantum mechanics |date=1987 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=978-0-07-085643-1 |edition=3. ed., 24. print |series=International series in pure and applied physics |location=New York}}</ref>
<math display="block">\mathbf{j}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\hbar}{2mi} \left( \psi^*(\mathbf{r}) \mathbf \nabla \psi(\mathbf{r}) - \psi(\mathbf{r}) \mathbf \nabla \psi^{*}(\mathbf{r}) \right) </math>
where <math>\nabla</math> is the [[del]] or [[gradient]] [[operator (mathematics)|operator]]. The momentum would then be described using the [[momentum operator|kinetic momentum operator]],<ref name="Schiff" />
<math display="block">\mathbf{p} = -i\hbar\nabla</math>
The wavelength is still described as the inverse of the modulus of the wavevector, although measurement is more complex. There are many cases where this approach is used to describe single-particle matter waves:
* [[Bloch wave]], which form the basis of much of [[band structure]] as described in [[Ashcroft and Mermin]], and are also used to describe the [[Electron diffraction|diffraction]] of high-energy electrons by solids.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Metherell |first=A. J. |title=Electron Microscopy in Materials Science |publisher=Commission of the European Communities |year=1972 |pages=397–552}}</ref><ref name="Peng"/>
* Waves with [[angular momentum]] such as [[electron vortex beam]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Verbeeck |first1=J. |last2=Tian |first2=H. |last3=Schattschneider |first3=P. |date=2010 |title=Production and application of electron vortex beams |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09366 |journal=Nature |language=en |volume=467 |issue=7313 |pages=301–304 |doi=10.1038/nature09366 |pmid=20844532 |bibcode=2010Natur.467..301V |s2cid=2970408 |issn=1476-4687}}</ref>
* [[Evanescent field|Evanescent waves]], where the component of the wavevector in one direction is complex. These are common when matter waves are being reflected, particularly for [[Grazing incidence diffraction|grazing-incidence diffraction]].

=== Collective matter waves ===
{{See also|List of quasiparticles}}
Other classes of matter waves involve more than one particle, so are called collective waves and are often [[quasiparticle]]s. Many of these occur in solids – see [[Ashcroft and Mermin]]. Examples include:
* In solids, an '''electron quasiparticle''' is an [[electron]] where interactions with other electrons in the solid have been included. An electron quasiparticle has the same [[electric charge|charge]] and [[Spin (physics)|spin]] as a "normal" ([[elementary particle]]) electron and, like a normal electron, it is a [[fermion]]. However, its [[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] can differ substantially from that of a normal electron.<ref name="Kaxiras">{{cite book|author=Efthimios Kaxiras|title=Atomic and Electronic Structure of Solids|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WTL_vgbWpHEC&pg=PA65|date=9 January 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52339-4|pages=65–69}}</ref> Its electric field is also modified, as a result of [[electric field screening]].
* A '''[[electron hole|hole]]''' is a quasiparticle which can be thought of as a [[Vacancy defect|vacancy]] of an electron in a state; it is most commonly used in the context of empty states in the [[valence band]] of a [[semiconductor]].<ref name="Kaxiras" /> A hole has the opposite charge of an electron.
* A '''[[polaron]]''' is a quasiparticle where an electron interacts with the [[polarization density|polarization]] of nearby atoms.
* An '''[[exciton]]''' is an electron and hole pair which are bound together.
* A [[Cooper pair]] is two electrons bound together so they behave as a single matter wave.

=== Standing matter waves ===
{{See also|Standing wave}}
[[File:InfiniteSquareWellAnimation.gif|thumb|200px|right|Some trajectories of a particle in a box according to [[Newton's laws]] of [[classical mechanics]] (A), and matter waves (B–F). In (B–F), the horizontal axis is position, and the vertical axis is the real part (blue) and imaginary part (red) of the [[wavefunction]]. The states (B,C,D) are [[energy eigenstate]]s, but (E,F) are not.]]
The third class are matter waves which have a wavevector, a wavelength and vary with time, but have a zero [[group velocity]] or [[probability flux]]. The simplest of these, similar to the notation above would be
<math display="block">\cos(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r} - \omega t)</math>
These occur as part of the [[particle in a box]], and other cases such as in a [[Particle in a ring|ring]]. This can, and arguably should be, extended to many other cases. For instance, in early work de Broglie used the concept that an electron matter wave must be continuous in a ring to connect to the [[Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization|Bohr–Sommerfeld condition]] in the early approaches to quantum mechanics.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Jammer |first=Max |title=The conceptual development of quantum mechanics |date=1989 |publisher=Thomas publishers |isbn=978-0-88318-617-6 |edition=2nd |series=The history of modern physics |location=Los Angeles (Calif.)}}</ref> In that sense [[atomic orbital]]s around atoms, and also [[molecular orbital]]s are electron matter waves.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Mulliken |first=Robert S. |date=1932 |title=Electronic Structures of Polyatomic Molecules and Valence.

Macroscopic apparatus fulfill this condition; [[Low-energy electron diffraction|slow electrons moving in solids]] do not.

Beyond the equations of motion, other aspects of matter wave optics differ from the corresponding light optics cases.

'''Sensitivity of matter waves to environmental condition.'''
Many examples of electromagnetic (light) [[Diffraction#Examples|diffraction]] occur in air under many environmental conditions. Obviously [[visible light]] interacts weakly with air molecules. By contrast, strongly interacting particles like slow electrons and molecules require vacuum: the matter wave properties rapidly fade when they are exposed to even low pressures of gas.<ref name="Schlosshauer">{{Cite journal |last=Schlosshauer |first=Maximilian |date=2019-10-01 |title=Quantum decoherence |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0370157319303084 |journal=Physics Reports |language=en |volume=831 |pages=1–57 |arxiv=1911.06282 |doi=10.1016/j.physrep.2019.10.001|bibcode=2019PhR...831....1S |s2cid=208006050 }}</ref> With special apparatus, high velocity electrons can be used to study [[Liquid-Phase Electron Microscopy|liquids]] and [[Gas electron diffraction|gases]].

'''Dispersion.''' Light waves of all frequencies travel at the same [[speed of light]] while matter wave velocity varies strongly with frequency. The relationship between frequency (proportional to energy) and wavenumber or velocity (proportional to momentum) is called a [[Dispersion relation#De Broglie dispersion relations|dispersion relation]]. Light waves in a vacuum have linear dispersion relation between frequency: <math>\omega = ck</math>. For matter waves the relation is non-linear:
<math display=block>\omega(k) \approx \frac{m_0 c^2}{\hbar} + \frac{\hbar k^2}{2m_{0} }\,.</math>
This non-relativistic [[Dispersion relation#De Broglie dispersion relations|matter wave dispersion relation]] says the frequency in vacuum varies with wavenumber (<math>k=1/\lambda</math>) in  two parts: a constant part due to the de Broglie frequency of the rest mass (<math>\hbar \omega_0 = m_{0}c^2</math>) and a quadratic part due to kinetic energy. The quadratic term causes rapid spreading of [[Wave packet#Gaussian wave packets in quantum mechanics|wave packets of matter waves]].

'''Coherence''' The visibility of diffraction features using an optical theory approach depends on the beam [[coherence (physics)|coherence]],<ref name="BornAndWolf" /> which at the quantum level is equivalent to a [[density matrix]] approach.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Fano |first=U. |date=1957 |title=Description of States in Quantum Mechanics by Density Matrix and Operator Techniques |url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/RevModPhys.29.74 |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |language=en |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=74–93 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.29.74 |issn=0034-6861}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Hall |first=Brian C. |title=Systems and Subsystems, Multiple Particles |date=2013 |url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-4614-7116-5_19 |work=Quantum Theory for Mathematicians |series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics |volume=267 |pages=419–440 |access-date=2023-08-13 |place=New York, NY |publisher=Springer New York |language=en |doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-7116-5_19 |isbn=978-1-4614-7115-8}}</ref> As with light, transverse coherence (across the direction of propagation) can be increased by [[collimator|collimation]].

'''Optically shaped matter waves'''
Optical manipulation of matter plays a critical role in matter wave optics: "Light waves can act as refractive, reflective, and absorptive structures for matter waves, just as glass interacts with light waves."<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Cronin |first1=Alexander D. |last2=Schmiedmayer |first2=Jörg |last3=Pritchard |first3=David E. |date=2009-07-28 |title=Optics and interferometry with atoms and molecules |url=http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/52372 |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |language=en |volume=81 |issue=3 |pages=1051–1129 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.81.1051 |arxiv=0712.3703 |bibcode=2009RvMP...81.1051C |hdl=1721.1/52372 |s2cid=28009912 |issn=0034-6861}}</ref> Laser light momentum transfer can [[Laser cooling|cool matter particles]] and alter the internal excitation state of atoms.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/sciadv.abq2659 | doi=10.1126/sciadv.abq2659 | title=Optical manipulation of matter waves | date=2022 | last1=Akbari | first1=Kamran | last2=Di Giulio | first2=Valerio | last3=García De Abajo | first3=F.

'''Multi-particle experiments'''
While single-particle free-space optical and matter wave equations are identical, multiparticle systems like [[Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect|coincidence]] experiments are not.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Brukner |first1=Časlav |last2=Zeilinger |first2=Anton |date=1997-10-06 |title=Nonequivalence between Stationary Matter Wave Optics and Stationary Light Optics |url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.79.2599 |journal=Physical Review Letters |language=en |volume=79 |issue=14 |pages=2599–2603 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.79.2599 |bibcode=1997PhRvL..79.2599B |issn=0031-9007}}</ref>

== Applications of matter waves ==
The following subsections provide links to pages describing applications of matter waves as probes of materials or of fundamental [[Wave–particle duality|quantum properties]]. In most cases these involve some method of producing travelling matter waves which initially have the simple form <math>\exp(i \mathbf{k}\cdot \mathbf{r} - i\omega t)</math>, then using these to probe materials.

As shown in the table below, matter wave [[invariant mass|mass]] ranges over 6 [[Orders of magnitude (mass)|orders of magnitude]] and [[energy]] over 9 orders but the wavelengths are all in the [[picometre]] range, comparable to atomic spacings. ([[Atomic radius|Atomic diameters]] range from 62 to 520&nbsp;pm, and the typical length of a [[Carbon–carbon bond|carbon–carbon single bond]] is 154&nbsp;pm.) Reaching longer wavelengths requires special techniques like [[laser cooling]] to reach lower energies; shorter wavelengths make diffraction effects more difficult to discern.<ref name="Adams Sigel Mlynek 1994 pp. 143–210" /> Therefore, many applications focus on [[material]] structures, in parallel with applications of electromagnetic waves, especially [[X-rays]]. Unlike light, matter wave particles may have [[invariant mass|mass]], [[electric charge]], [[magnetic moments]], and internal structure, presenting new challenges and opportunities.

=== Electrons ===
[[Electron diffraction]] patterns emerge when energetic electrons reflect or penetrate ordered solids; analysis of the patterns leads to models of the atomic arrangement in the solids.

They are used for imaging from the micron to atomic scale using [[electron microscopes]], in [[Transmission electron microscope|transmission]], using [[Scanning transmission electron microscope|scanning]], and for surfaces at [[Low-energy electron microscopy|low energies]].

The measurements of the energy they lose in [[electron energy loss spectroscopy]] provides information about the chemistry and electronic structure of materials. Beams of electrons also lead to characteristic X-rays in [[Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy|energy dispersive spectroscopy]] which can produce information about chemical content at the nanoscale.

[[Quantum tunneling]] explains how electrons escape from metals in an electrostatic field at energies less than classical predictions allow: the matter wave penetrates of the work function barrier in the metal.

[[Scanning tunneling microscope]] leverages [[quantum tunneling]] to image the top atomic layer of solid surfaces.

[[Electron holography]], the electron matter wave analog of optical [[holography]], probes the electric and magnetic fields in thin films.

=== Neutrons ===
[[Neutron diffraction]] complements [[x-ray diffraction]] through the different [[Cross section (physics)|scattering cross sections]] and sensitivity to magnetism.

[[Small-angle neutron scattering]] provides way to obtain structure of disordered systems that is sensitivity to light elements, isotopes and magnetic moments.

[[Neutron reflectometry]] is a neutron diffraction technique for measuring the structure of thin films.

=== Neutral atoms ===
[[Atom interferometer]]s, similar to [[interferometer|optical interferometers]], measure the difference in phase between atomic matter waves along different paths.

[[Atom optics]] mimic many light optic devices, including [[Atomic mirror|mirrors]], atom focusing zone plates.

[[Scanning helium microscopy]] uses He atom waves to image solid structures non-destructively.

[[Quantum reflection]] uses matter wave behavior to explain grazing angle atomic reflection, the basis of some [[atomic mirror]]s.

[[Quantum decoherence#Experimental observations|Quantum decoherence]] measurements rely on Rb atom wave interference.

=== Molecules ===
[[Quantum superposition#Experiments and applications|Quantum superposition]] revealed by interference of matter waves from large molecules probes the limits of [[wave–particle duality]] and quantum macroscopicity.<ref name=fein1242/><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Nimmrichter |first1=Stefan |last2=Hornberger |first2=Klaus |date=2013-04-18 |title=Macroscopicity of Mechanical Quantum Superposition States |url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.160403 |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=110 |issue=16 |pages=160403 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.160403|pmid=23679586 |arxiv=1205.3447 |s2cid=12088376 }}</ref>
