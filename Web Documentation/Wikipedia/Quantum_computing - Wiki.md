A '''quantum computer''' is a [[computer]] that takes advantage of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] phenomena.

At small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of [[wave-particle duality|both particles and waves]], and quantum computing leverages this behavior, specifically quantum [[Quantum superposition|superposition]] and [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]], using specialized hardware that supports the preparation and manipulation of [[quantum state]]s.

[[Classical physics]] cannot explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster (with respect to input size scaling)<ref>Here and in the following „exponentially faster” has a precise [[computational complexity|complexity theoretical]] meaning, namely that as a function of input size (in bits) the best classical algorithm for a problem requires an [[exponential growth|exponentially growing]] number of steps, while the best quantum algorithm only needs a polynomial number of steps.</ref> than any modern [[classical computer|"classical" computer]]. In particular, a large-scale quantum computer could [[post-quantum cryptography|break widely used encryption schemes]] and aid physicists in performing [[quantum simulator|physical simulations]]; however, the current state of the technology is largely experimental and impractical, with several obstacles to useful applications. Moreover, scalable quantum computers do not hold promise for many practical tasks, and for many important tasks [[quantum speedup]]s are proven impossible.

<!-- Basic principles of quantum computing -->
The basic [[unit of information]] in quantum computing is the [[qubit]], similar to the [[bit]] in traditional digital electronics. Unlike a classical bit, a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two "basis" states. When [[measurement in quantum mechanics|measuring]] a qubit, the result is a [[Born rule|probabilistic output]] of a classical bit, therefore making quantum computers nondeterministic in general. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, [[wave interference]] effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The design of [[quantum algorithms]] involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently and quickly.

<!--Physical implementations-->
Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently [[isolated system|isolated]] from its environment, it suffers from [[quantum decoherence]], introducing [[noise (signal processing)|noise]] into calculations. Paradoxically, perfectly isolating qubits is also undesirable because quantum computations typically need to initialize qubits, perform controlled qubit interactions, and measure the resulting quantum states. Each of those operations introduces errors and suffers from noise, and such inaccuracies accumulate.

<!-- Computability and complexity -->
In principle, a non-quantum (classical) computer can solve the same computational problems as a quantum computer, given enough time. Quantum advantage comes in the form of [[time complexity]] rather than [[computability]], and [[quantum complexity theory]] shows that some quantum algorithms for carefully selected tasks require exponentially fewer computational steps than the best known non-quantum algorithms. Such tasks can in theory be solved on a large-scale quantum computer whereas [[classical computer]]s would not finish computations in any reasonable amount of time. However, quantum speedup is not universal or even typical across computational tasks, since basic tasks such as [[sorting]] are proven to not allow any asymptotic quantum speedup. Claims of ''[[quantum supremacy]]'' have drawn significant attention to the discipline, but are demonstrated on contrived tasks, while near-term practical use cases remain limited.

== Quantum information processing ==
{{See also|Introduction to quantum mechanics}}

[[Computer engineer]]s typically describe a [[modern computer]]'s operation in terms of [[classical electrodynamics]].
Within these "classical" computers, some components (such as [[semiconductors]] and [[random number generators]]) may rely on quantum behavior, but these components are not [[isolated system|isolated]] from their environment, so any [[quantum information]] quickly [[quantum decoherence|decoheres]].
While [[programmers]] may depend on [[probability theory]] when designing a [[randomized algorithm]], quantum mechanical notions like [[quantum superposition|superposition]] and [[quantum interference|interference]] are largely irrelevant for [[program analysis]].

[[Quantum program]]s, in contrast, rely on precise control of [[quantum coherence|coherent]] quantum systems. Physicists [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|describe these systems mathematically]] using [[linear algebra]]. [[Complex number]]s model [[probability amplitude]]s, [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vectors]] model [[quantum state]]s, and [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] model the operations that can be performed on these states. Programming a quantum computer is then a matter of [[function composition (computer science)|composing]] operations in such a way that the resulting program computes a useful result in theory and is implementable in practice.

Bennett (physicist)|Charlie Bennett]] describes the relationship between quantum and classical computers,<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/live/rslt-LwtDK4&t=4102 |title=Information Is Quantum: How Physics Helped Explain the Nature of Information and What Can Be Done With It |date=2020-07-31 |last=Bennett |first=Charlie |type=Videotape |author-link=Charles H.

=== Quantum information ===
[[File:Bloch sphere.svg|thumb|[[Bloch sphere]] representation of a qubit. The state <math>| \psi \rangle = \alpha |0 \rangle + \beta |1 \rangle</math> is a point on the surface of the sphere, partway between the poles, <math>|0\rangle</math> and <math>|1\rangle</math>.]]
Just as the bit is the basic concept of classical information theory, the ''[[qubit]]'' is the fundamental unit of [[quantum information]]. The same term ''qubit'' is used to refer to an abstract mathematical model and to any physical system that is represented by that model. A classical bit, by definition, exists in either of two physical states, which can be denoted 0 and 1. A qubit is also described by a state, and two states often written <math>|0\rangle</math> and <math>|1\rangle</math> serve as the quantum counterparts of the classical states 0 and 1. However, the quantum states <math>|0\rangle</math> and <math>|1\rangle</math> belong to a [[vector space]], meaning that they can be multiplied by constants and added together, and the result is again a valid quantum state. Such a combination is known as a ''superposition'' of <math>|0\rangle</math> and <math>|1\rangle</math>.{{sfn|Nielsen|Chuang|2010|page=13}}{{sfn|Mermin|2007|p=17}}

A two-dimensional [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] mathematically represents a qubit state. Physicists typically use [[Dirac notation]] for quantum mechanical [[linear algebra]], writing <math>|\psi\rangle</math> {{gloss|ket [[psi (Greek)|psi]]}} for a vector labeled <math>\psi</math> . Because a qubit is a two-state system, any qubit state takes the form <math>\alpha|0\rangle+\beta|1\rangle</math> , where <math>|0\rangle</math> and <math>|1\rangle</math> are the standard ''basis states'',{{efn|The [[standard basis]] is also the ''computational basis''.{{sfn|Mermin|2007|p=18}}}} and <math>\alpha</math> and <math>\beta</math> are the ''[[probability amplitude]]s,'' which are in general [[complex numbers]].{{sfn|Mermin|2007|p=17}} If either <math>\alpha</math> or <math>\beta</math> is zero, the qubit is effectively a classical bit; when both are nonzero, the qubit is in superposition. Such a [[quantum state vector]] acts similarly to a (classical) [[probability vector]], with one key difference: unlike probabilities, probability {{em|amplitudes}} are not necessarily positive numbers.{{sfn|Aaronson|2013|page=110}} Negative amplitudes allow for destructive wave interference.

When a qubit is [[quantum measurement|measured]] in the [[standard basis]], the result is a classical bit.
The [[Born rule]] describes the [[norm-squared]] correspondence between amplitudes and probabilities{{mdash}}when measuring a qubit <math>\alpha|0\rangle+\beta|1\rangle</math>, the state [[wave function collapse|collapses]] to <math>|0\rangle</math> with probability <math>|\alpha|^2</math>, or to <math>|1\rangle</math> with probability <math>|\beta|^2</math>.
Any valid qubit state has coefficients <math>\alpha</math> and <math>\beta</math> such that <math>|\alpha|^2+|\beta|^2 = 1</math>.
As an example, measuring the qubit <math>1/\sqrt {2}|0\rangle+1/\sqrt{2}|1\rangle</math> would produce either <math>|0\rangle</math> or <math>|1\rangle</math> with equal probability.

Each additional qubit doubles the [[dimension (vector space)|dimension]] of the [[state space (physics)|state space]].{{sfn|Mermin|2007|p=18}}
As an example, the vector {{nowrap|{{sfrac|1|√2}}{{ket|00}} + {{sfrac|1|√2}}{{ket|01}}}} represents a two-qubit state, a [[tensor product]] of the qubit {{ket|0}} with the qubit {{nowrap|{{sfrac|1|√2}}{{ket|0}} + {{sfrac|1|√2}}{{ket|1}}}}.
This vector inhabits a four-dimensional [[vector space]] spanned by the basis vectors {{ket|00}}, {{ket|01}}, {{ket|10}}, and {{ket|11}}.
The [[Bell state]] {{nowrap|{{sfrac|1|√2}}{{ket|00}} + {{sfrac|1|√2}}{{ket|11}}}} is impossible to decompose into the tensor product of two individual qubits{{mdash}}the two qubits are ''[[quantum entanglement|entangled]]'' because their probability amplitudes are [[correlated]].
In general, the vector space for an ''n''-qubit system is 2<sup>''n''</sup>-dimensional, and this makes it challenging for a classical computer to simulate a quantum one: representing a 100-qubit system requires storing 2<sup>100</sup> classical values.

=== Unitary operators<span class="anchor" id="gate-application"></span> ===
{{See also|Unitarity (physics)}}

The state of this one-qubit [[quantum memory]] can be manipulated by applying [[quantum logic gate]]s, analogous to how classical memory can be manipulated with [[Logic gate|classical logic gates]]. One important gate for both classical and quantum computation is the NOT gate, which can be represented by a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]
<math display="block">X := \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.</math>
Mathematically, the application of such a logic gate to a quantum state vector is modelled with [[matrix multiplication]]. Thus
: <math>X|0\rangle = |1\rangle</math> and <math>X|1\rangle = |0\rangle</math>.
The mathematics of single qubit gates can be extended to operate on multi-qubit quantum memories in two important ways. One way is simply to select a qubit and apply that gate to the target qubit while leaving the remainder of the memory unaffected. Another way is to apply the gate to its target only if another part of the memory is in a desired state. These two choices can be illustrated using another example. The possible states of a two-qubit quantum memory are
<math display="block">
 |00\rangle := \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix};\quad
 |01\rangle := \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix};\quad
 |10\rangle := \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix};\quad
 |11\rangle := \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
</math>
The [[Controlled NOT gate|controlled NOT (CNOT)]] gate can then be represented using the following matrix:
<math display="block">
 \operatorname{CNOT} :=
 \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
   0 & 0 & 1 & 0
 \end{pmatrix}.
</math>
As a mathematical consequence of this definition, <math display="inline">\operatorname{CNOT}|00\rangle = |00\rangle</math>, <math display="inline">\operatorname{CNOT}|01\rangle = |01\rangle</math>, <math display="inline">\operatorname{CNOT}|10\rangle = |11\rangle</math>, and <math display="inline">\operatorname{CNOT}|11\rangle = |10\rangle</math>. In other words, the CNOT applies a NOT gate (<math display="inline">X</math> from before) to the second qubit if and only if the first qubit is in the state <math display="inline">|1\rangle</math>. If the first qubit is <math display="inline">|0\rangle</math>, nothing is done to either qubit.

In summary, quantum computation can be described as a network of quantum logic gates and measurements. However, any [[deferred measurement principle|measurement can be deferred]] to the end of quantum computation, though this deferment may come at a computational cost, so most [[quantum circuit]]s depict a network consisting only of quantum logic gates and no measurements.

=== Quantum parallelism ===

''Quantum parallelism'' is the heuristic that quantum computers can be thought of as evaluating a function for multiple input values simultaneously. This can be achieved by preparing a quantum system in a superposition of input states, and applying a unitary transformation that encodes the function to be evaluated. The resulting state encodes the function's output values for all input values in the superposition, allowing for the computation of multiple outputs simultaneously. This property is key to the speedup of many quantum algorithms. However, "parallelism" in this sense is insufficient to speed up a computation, because the measurement at the end of the computation gives only one value. To be useful, a quantum algorithm must also incorporate some other conceptual ingredient.{{sfn|Nielsen|Chuang|2010|p=30–32}}{{sfn|Mermin|2007|pp=38–39}}

=== Quantum programming<span class="anchor" id="Models of computation for quantum computing"></span> ===
{{Further|Quantum programming}}

There are a number of [[model of computation|models of computation]] for quantum computing, distinguished by the basic elements in which the computation is decomposed.

==== Gate array {{anchor|Quantum circuit|Definition}} ====
[[File:Quantum Toffoli Gate Implementation.svg|thumb|A quantum circuit diagram implementing a [[Toffoli gate]] from [[Quantum logic gate|more primitive gates]]|upright=1.15]]

A [[quantum circuit|quantum gate array]] decomposes computation into a sequence of few-qubit [[quantum gate]]s. A quantum computation can be described as a network of quantum logic gates and measurements. However, any measurement can be deferred to the end of quantum computation, though this deferment may come at a computational cost, so most [[quantum circuit]]s depict a network consisting only of quantum logic gates and no measurements.

Any quantum computation (which is, in the above formalism, any [[unitary matrix]] of size <math>2^n \times 2^n</math> over <math>n</math> qubits) can be represented as a network of quantum logic gates from a fairly small family of gates. A choice of gate family that enables this construction is known as a [[Quantum logic gate#Universal quantum gates|universal gate set]], since a computer that can run such circuits is a [[universal quantum computer]]. One common such set includes all single-qubit gates as well as the CNOT gate from above. This means any quantum computation can be performed by executing a sequence of single-qubit gates together with CNOT gates. Though this gate set is infinite, it can be replaced with a finite gate set by appealing to the [[Solovay–Kitaev theorem|Solovay-Kitaev theorem]].

==== Measurement-based quantum computing ====

A [[measurement-based quantum computer]] decomposes computation into a sequence of [[Bell state#Bell state measurement|Bell state measurements]] and single-qubit [[quantum gate]]s applied to a highly entangled initial state (a [[cluster state]]), using a technique called [[quantum gate teleportation]].

==== Adiabatic quantum computing ====

An [[Adiabatic quantum computation|adiabatic quantum computer]], based on [[quantum annealing]], decomposes computation into a slow continuous transformation of an initial [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] into a final Hamiltonian, whose ground states contain the solution.<ref name="Das 2008 1061–1081">{{cite journal|last1=Das|first1=A.|last2=Chakrabarti|first2=B.

==== Neuromorphic quantum computing ====
Neuromorphic quantum computing (abbreviated as ‘n.quantum computing’) is an unconventional computing type of computing that uses [[Neuromorphic engineering|neuromorphic computing]] to perform quantum operations. It was suggested that [[Quantum algorithm|quantum algorithms]], which are algorithms that run on a realistic model of [[Quantum computing|quantum computation]], can be computed equally efficiently with neuromorphic quantum computing. Both, traditional [[quantum computing]] and neuromorphic quantum computing are physics-based unconventional computing approaches to computations and don’t follow the [[von Neumann architecture]]. They both construct a system (a circuit) that represents the physical problem at hand, and then leverage their respective physics properties of the system to seek the “minimum”. Neuromorphic quantum computing and [[quantum computing]] share similar physical properties during computation.

==== Topological quantum computing ====

A [[topological quantum computer]] decomposes computation into the braiding of [[anyon]]s in a 2D lattice.<ref name="Nayaketal2008">{{cite journal |last1=Nayak |first1=Chetan |last2=Simon |first2=Steven |last3=Stern |first3=Ady |last4=Das Sarma |first4=Sankar |year=2008 |title=Nonabelian Anyons and Quantum Computation |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume=80 |issue=3 |pages=1083–1159 |arxiv=0707.1889 |bibcode=2008RvMP...80.1083N |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.80.1083 |s2cid=119628297}}</ref>

This equivalence need not hold for practical quantum computers, since the overhead of simulation may be too large to be practical.

=== Quantum cryptography and cybersecurity ===
Quantum computing has significant potential applications in the fields of cryptography and cybersecurity. Quantum cryptography, which relies on the principles of quantum mechanics, offers the possibility of secure communication channels that are resistant to eavesdropping. Quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, such as BB84, enable the secure exchange of cryptographic keys between parties, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of communication. Moreover, quantum random number generators (QRNGs) can produce high-quality random numbers, which are essential for secure encryption.

However, quantum computing also poses challenges to traditional cryptographic systems. Shor's algorithm, a quantum algorithm for integer factorization, could potentially break widely used public-key cryptography schemes like RSA, which rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. Post-quantum cryptography, which involves the development of cryptographic algorithms that are resistant to attacks by both classical and quantum computers, is an active area of research aimed at addressing this concern.

Ongoing research in quantum cryptography and post-quantum cryptography is crucial for ensuring the security of communication and data in the face of evolving quantum computing capabilities. Advances in these fields, such as the development of new QKD protocols, the improvement of QRNGs, and the standardization of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, will play a key role in maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of information in the quantum era.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pirandola |first1=S. |last2=Andersen |first2=U.

== Algorithms ==

<!-- Overview of quantum algorithms, particularly abstract routines with no explicit application -->
Progress in finding [[quantum algorithms]] typically focuses on this quantum circuit model, though exceptions like the [[Adiabatic quantum computation|quantum adiabatic algorithm]] exist.

Quantum algorithms that offer more than a polynomial speedup over the best-known classical algorithm include [[Shor's algorithm]] for factoring and the related quantum algorithms for computing [[discrete logarithm]]s, solving [[Pell's equation]], and more generally solving the [[hidden subgroup problem]] for [[Abelian group|abelian]] finite groups.<ref name="zoo"/> These algorithms depend on the primitive of the [[quantum Fourier transform]].

Other problems, including the simulation of quantum physical processes from chemistry and solid-state physics, the approximation of certain [[Jones polynomial]]s, and the [[quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations]] have quantum algorithms appearing to give super-polynomial speedups and are [[BQP]]-complete.

=== Post-quantum cryptography ===
{{Main|Post-quantum cryptography}}

A notable application of quantum computation is for [[cryptanalysis|attacks]] on cryptographic systems that are currently in use. [[Integer factorization]], which underpins the security of [[public key cryptography|public key cryptographic]] systems, is believed to be computationally infeasible with an ordinary computer for large integers if they are the product of few [[prime number]]s (e.g., products of two 300-digit primes).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lenstra |first=Arjen K. |url=http://sage.math.washington.edu/edu/124/misc/arjen_lenstra_factoring.pdf |title=Integer Factoring |journal=Designs, Codes and Cryptography |volume=19 |pages=101–128 |year=2000 |doi=10.1023/A:1008397921377 |issue=2/3 |s2cid=9816153 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410234239/http://sage.math.washington.edu/edu/124/misc/arjen_lenstra_factoring.pdf |archive-date=10 April 2015 }}</ref> By comparison, a quantum computer could solve this problem exponentially faster using [[Shor's algorithm]] to find its factors.{{sfn|Nielsen|Chuang|2010|p=216}} This ability would allow a quantum computer to break many of the [[cryptography|cryptographic]] systems in use today, in the sense that there would be a [[polynomial time]] (in the number of digits of the integer) algorithm for solving the problem. In particular, most of the popular [[Asymmetric Algorithms|public key ciphers]] are based on the difficulty of factoring integers or the [[discrete logarithm]] problem, both of which can be solved by Shor's algorithm. In particular, the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]], [[Diffie–Hellman]], and [[elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman]] algorithms could be broken. These are used to protect secure Web pages, encrypted email, and many other types of data. Breaking these would have significant ramifications for electronic privacy and security.

=== Search problems<span class="anchor" id="Quantum search"></span> ===
{{Main|Grover's algorithm}}

The most well-known example of a problem that allows for a polynomial quantum speedup is ''unstructured search'', which involves finding a marked item out of a list of <math>n</math> items in a database. This can be solved by [[Grover's algorithm]] using <math>O(\sqrt{n})</math> queries to the database, quadratically fewer than the <math>\Omega(n)</math> queries required for classical algorithms. In this case, the advantage is not only provable but also optimal: it has been shown that Grover's algorithm gives the maximal possible probability of finding the desired element for any number of oracle lookups. Many examples of provable quantum speedups for query problems are based on Grover's algorithm, including [[BHT algorithm|Brassard, Høyer, and Tapp's algorithm]] for finding collisions in two-to-one functions,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2016 |title=Quantum Algorithm for the Collision Problem |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Algorithms |publisher=Springer |place=New York, New York |editor-last=Kao |editor-first=Ming-Yang |pages=1662–1664 |language=en |arxiv=quant-ph/9705002 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4939-2864-4_304 |isbn=978-1-4939-2864-4 |last2=Høyer |first2=Peter |last3=Tapp |first3=Alain |last1=Brassard |first1=Gilles |s2cid=3116149}}</ref> and Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann's algorithm for evaluating NAND trees.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Farhi |first1=Edward |last2=Goldstone |first2=Jeffrey |last3=Gutmann |first3=Sam |date=23 December 2008 |title=A Quantum Algorithm for the Hamiltonian NAND Tree |journal=Theory of Computing |language=EN |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=169–190 |doi=10.4086/toc.2008.v004a008 |s2cid=8258191 |issn=1557-2862 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

Problems that can be efficiently addressed with Grover's algorithm have the following properties:<ref>{{cite book |author=Williams |first=Colin P. |title=Explorations in Quantum Computing |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-84628-887-6 |pages=242–244}}</ref><ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Grover| first=Lov| author-link=Lov Grover |title=A fast quantum mechanical algorithm for database search |date=29 May 1996| eprint=quant-ph/9605043}}</ref>

#The number of possible answers to check is the same as the number of inputs to the algorithm, and
#There exists a boolean function that evaluates each input and determines whether it is the correct answer.

For problems with all these properties, the running time of Grover's algorithm on a quantum computer scales as the square root of the number of inputs (or elements in the database), as opposed to the linear scaling of classical algorithms.

* Physically scalable to increase the number of qubits
* Qubits that can be initialized to arbitrary values
* Quantum gates that are faster than [[decoherence]] time
* Universal gate set
* Qubits that can be read easily.

Sourcing parts for quantum computers is also very difficult. [[Superconducting quantum computing|Superconducting quantum computers]], like those constructed by [[Google]] and [[IBM]], need [[helium-3]], a [[Nuclear physics|nuclear]] research byproduct, and special [[superconducting]] cables made only by the Japanese company Coax Co.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Giles |first1=Martin |date=January 17, 2019 |title=We'd have more quantum computers if it weren't so hard to find the damn cables |language=en-US |publisher=MIT Technology Review |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612760/quantum-computers-component-shortage/ |access-date=May 17, 2021}}</ref>

The control of multi-qubit systems requires the generation and coordination of a large number of electrical signals with tight and deterministic timing resolution. This has led to the development of [[quantum controllers]] that enable interfacing with the qubits. Scaling these systems to support a growing number of qubits is an additional challenge.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Pauka SJ, Das K, Kalra B, Moini A, Yang Y, Trainer M, Bousquet A, Cantaloube C, Dick N, Gardner GC, Manfra MJ, Reilly DJ|journal=[[Nature Electronics]]|title=A cryogenic CMOS chip for generating control signals for multiple qubits|year=2021|volume=4|issue=4|pages=64–70 |doi=10.1038/s41928-020-00528-y|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-020-00528-y|arxiv=1912.01299|s2cid=231715555}}</ref>

==== Decoherence<span class="anchor" id="Quantum decoherence"></span> ====

One of the greatest challenges involved with constructing quantum computers is controlling or removing [[quantum decoherence]]. This usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include the quantum gates, and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate systems in particular, the transverse relaxation time ''T''<sub>2</sub> (for [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] and [[MRI]] technology, also called the ''dephasing time''), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature.<ref name="DiVincenzo 1995">{{cite journal |last=DiVincenzo |first=David P. |title=Quantum Computation |journal=Science |year=1995 |volume=270 |issue=5234 |pages=255–261 |doi=10.1126/science.270.5234.255 |bibcode=1995Sci...270..255D |citeseerx=10.1.1.242.2165 |s2cid=220110562}}</ref> Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvin (usually using a [[dilution refrigerator]]<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cryogenics.2021.103390| issn=0011-2275 |title=Development of Dilution refrigerators – A review |journal=Cryogenics| volume=121| year=2022| last1=Zu| first1=H.| last2=Dai| first2=W.| last3=de Waele| first3=A.T.A.M.| s2cid=244005391}}</ref>) in order to prevent significant decoherence.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Nicola |title=Computing: The quantum company |journal=Nature |date=19 June 2013 |volume=498 |issue=7454 |pages=286–288 |doi=10.1038/498286a|pmid=23783610|bibcode=2013Natur.498..286J|doi-access=free}}</ref> A 2020 study argues that [[ionizing radiation]] such as [[cosmic rays]] can nevertheless cause certain systems to decohere within milliseconds.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vepsäläinen |first1=Antti P. |last2=Karamlou |first2=Amir H. |last3=Orrell |first3=John L. |last4=Dogra |first4=Akshunna S. |last5=Loer |first5=Ben |last6=Vasconcelos |first6=Francisca |last7=Kim |first7=David K. |last8=Melville |first8=Alexander J. |last9=Niedzielski |first9=Bethany M. |last10=Yoder |first10=Jonilyn L. |last11=Gustavsson |first11=Simon |last12=Formaggio |first12=Joseph A. |last13=VanDevender |first13=Brent A. |last14=Oliver |first14=William D. |display-authors=5 |title=Impact of ionizing radiation on superconducting qubit coherence |journal=Nature |date=August 2020 |volume=584 |issue=7822 |pages=551–556 |doi=10.1038/s41586-020-2619-8 |pmid=32848227 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2619-8 |language=en |issn=1476-4687|arxiv=2001.09190 |bibcode=2020Natur.584..551V |s2cid=210920566 }}</ref>

These issues are more difficult for optical approaches as the timescales are orders of magnitude shorter and an often-cited approach to overcoming them is optical [[pulse shaping]]. Error rates are typically proportional to the ratio of operating time to decoherence time, hence any operation must be completed much more quickly than the decoherence time.

As described by the [[threshold theorem]], if the error rate is small enough, it is thought to be possible to use [[quantum error correction]] to suppress errors and decoherence. This allows the total calculation time to be longer than the decoherence time if the error correction scheme can correct errors faster than decoherence introduces them. An often-cited figure for the required error rate in each gate for fault-tolerant computation is 10<sup>−3</sup>, assuming the noise is depolarizing.

Meeting this scalability condition is possible for a wide range of systems. However, the use of error correction brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required qubits. The number required to factor integers using Shor's algorithm is still polynomial, and thought to be between ''L'' and ''L''<sup>2</sup>, where ''L'' is the number of digits in the number to be factored; error correction algorithms would inflate this figure by an additional factor of ''L''. For a 1000-bit number, this implies a need for about 10<sup>4</sup> bits without error correction.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dyakonov |first=M.

=== Skepticism ===

Despite high hopes for quantum computing, significant progress in hardware, and optimism about future applications, a 2023 [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] spotlight article summarised current quantum computers as being "For now, [good for] absolutely nothing".<ref name="good-for-nothing">
{{Cite journal| journal = Nature | title = Quantum computers: what are they good for? | date = 24 May 2023 | first = Michael | last = Brooks| volume = 617 | issue = 7962 | pages = S1–S3 | doi = 10.1038/d41586-023-01692-9 | pmid = 37225885 | bibcode = 2023Natur.617S...1B | s2cid = 258847001 | doi-access = free }}
</ref> The article elaborated that quantum computers are yet to be more useful or efficient than conventional computers in any case, though it also argued that in the long term such computers are likely to be useful.

</ref> found that current quantum computing algorithms are "insufficient for practical quantum advantage without significant improvements across the software/hardware stack". It argues that the most promising candidates for achieving speedup with quantum computers are "small-data problems", for example in chemistry and materials science. However, the article also concludes that a large range of the potential applications it considered, such as machine learning, "will not achieve quantum advantage with current quantum algorithms in the foreseeable future", and it identified I/O constraints that make speedup unlikely for "big data problems, unstructured linear systems, and database search based on Grover's algorithm".

This state of affairs can be traced to several current and long-term considerations.

* Conventional computer hardware and algorithms are not only optimized for practical tasks, but are still improving rapidly, particularly [[GPU]] accelerators. 
* Current quantum computing hardware generates only a limited amount of [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]] before getting overwhelmed by noise.
* [[Quantum algorithm]]s provide speedup over conventional algorithms only for some tasks, and matching these tasks with practical applications proved challenging. Some promising tasks and applications require resources far beyond those available today.<ref>{{Cite web| url = https://m-cacm.acm.org/magazines/2022/12/266916-quantum-computers-and-the-universe/fulltext | publisher = Communications of the ACM |

</ref> In particular, processing large amounts of non-quantum data is a challenge for quantum computers.<ref name=CACM/>
* Some promising algorithms have been "dequantized", i.e., their non-quantum analogues with similar complexity have been found.
* If [[quantum error correction]] is used to scale quantum computers to practical applications, its overhead may undermine speedup offered by many quantum algorithms.<ref name=CACM/>
* Complexity analysis of algorithms sometimes makes abstract assumptions that do not hold in applications. For example, input data may not already be available encoded in quantum states, and "oracle functions" used in [[Grover's algorithm]] often have internal structure that can be exploited for faster algorithms.

In particular, building computers with large numbers of qubits may be futile if those qubits are not connected well enough and cannot maintain sufficiently high degree of entanglement for long time. When trying to outperform conventional computers, quantum computing researchers often look for new tasks that can be solved on quantum computers, but this leaves the possibility that efficient non-quantum techniques will be developed in response, as seen for [[Quantum supremacy]] demonstrations. Therefore, it is desirable to prove lower bounds on the complexity of best possible non-quantum algorithms (which may be unknown) and show that some quantum algorithms asymptomatically improve upon those bounds.

Some researchers have expressed skepticism that scalable quantum computers could ever be built, typically because of the issue of maintaining coherence at large scales, but also for other reasons.

{{Further|Computability theory}}

Any [[computational problem]] solvable by a classical computer is also solvable by a quantum computer.{{sfn|Nielsen|Chuang|2010|p=29}} Intuitively, this is because it is believed that all physical phenomena, including the operation of classical computers, can be described using [[quantum mechanics]], which underlies the operation of quantum computers.

Conversely, any problem solvable by a quantum computer is also solvable by a classical computer. It is possible to simulate both quantum and classical computers manually with just some paper and a pen, if given enough time. More formally, any quantum computer can be simulated by a [[Turing machine]]. In other words, quantum computers provide no additional power over classical computers in terms of [[computability]]. This means that quantum computers cannot solve [[undecidable problem]]s like the [[halting problem]], and the existence of quantum computers does not disprove the [[Church–Turing thesis]].{{sfn|Nielsen|Chuang|2010|p=126}}

=== Complexity<span class="anchor" id="Quantum complexity theory"></span> ===
{{Main|Quantum complexity theory}}

<!-- Power and limits of quantum computers -->
While quantum computers cannot solve any problems that classical computers cannot already solve, it is suspected that they can solve certain problems faster than classical computers. For instance, it is known that quantum computers can efficiently [[integer factorization|factor integers]], while this is not believed to be the case for classical computers.

<!-- Basic definition of BQP -->
The class of [[computational problem|problems]] that can be efficiently solved by a quantum computer with bounded error is called [[BQP]], for "bounded error, quantum, polynomial time". More formally, BQP is the class of problems that can be solved by a polynomial-time [[quantum Turing machine]] with an error probability of at most 1/3. As a class of probabilistic problems, BQP is the quantum counterpart to [[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]] ("bounded error, probabilistic, polynomial time"), the class of problems that can be solved by polynomial-time [[probabilistic Turing machine]]s with bounded error.{{sfn|Nielsen|Chuang|2010|p=41}} It is known that <math>\mathsf{BPP\subseteq BQP}</math> and is widely suspected that <math>\mathsf{BQP\subsetneq BPP}</math>, which intuitively would mean that quantum computers are more powerful than classical computers in terms of [[time complexity]].{{sfn|Nielsen|Chuang|2010|p=201}}

<!-- Relation of BQP to basic complexity classes -->
[[File:BQP complexity class diagram.svg|thumb|The suspected relationship of BQP to several classical complexity classes{{sfn|Nielsen|Chuang|2010|p=42}}]]
The exact relationship of BQP to [[P (complexity)|P]], [[NP (complexity)|NP]], and [[PSPACE (complexity)|PSPACE]] is not known. However, it is known that <math>\mathsf{P\subseteq BQP \subseteq PSPACE}</math>; that is, all problems that can be efficiently solved by a deterministic classical computer can also be efficiently solved by a quantum computer, and all problems that can be efficiently solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a deterministic classical computer with polynomial space resources. It is further suspected that BQP is a strict superset of P, meaning there are problems that are efficiently solvable by quantum computers that are not efficiently solvable by deterministic classical computers. For instance, [[integer factorization]] and the [[discrete logarithm problem]] are known to be in BQP and are suspected to be outside of P. On the relationship of BQP to NP, little is known beyond the fact that some NP problems that are believed not to be in P are also in BQP (integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problem are both in NP, for example). It is suspected that <math>\mathsf{NP\nsubseteq BQP}</math>; that is, it is believed that there are efficiently checkable problems that are not efficiently solvable by a quantum computer. As a direct consequence of this belief, it is also suspected that BQP is disjoint from the class of [[NP-complete]] problems (if an NP-complete problem were in BQP, then it would follow from [[NP-hard]]ness that all problems in NP are in BQP).<ref name=BernVazi>{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Ethan |last2=Vazirani |first2=Umesh |doi=10.1137/S0097539796300921 |title=Quantum Complexity Theory |year=1997 |pages=1411–1473 |volume=26 |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/bv.ps |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.144.7852 }}</ref>
