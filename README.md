## Project Overview

At the heart of Quantom Thoughts lies an exploration into an intriguing intuition: the potential for humans to influence the quantum state of the particles, neurons, and neurotransmitters in their own heads. 

This project delves into the possibility that, by entering a quantum state, humans may unlock abilities perceived as superpowers. 

Through quantum entanglement, concepts like telepathy and beyond-space communication become subjects of study, suggesting a profound connection between individual minds across time and space. 

The project seeks to bridge ancient wisdom with modern science, exploring the intersection of brain function, human experience, and even science fiction narratives, to understand the depth of our connection with the universe, and with each others.

It's a transdisciplinary inquiry into whether the phenomena attributed to the quantum realm—such as accessing collective knowledge or traversing dimensions—can be scientifically validated or remain compelling mysteries of human faith and imagination.

## Note on AI Assistance and Source Attribution

This project actively integrates insights generated with the assistance of ChatGPT, leveraging its capabilities to enrich the content and broaden the scope of our exploration. Wherever possible, we strive to link proofs and sources to ensure the reliability and veracity of the information presented. 

However, the vast and interdisciplinary nature of this project means that fully attributing every piece of knowledge is an ongoing effort. We welcome contributions, corrections, and suggestions to help us improve and maintain the accuracy and integrity of our work. Your understanding and patience are greatly appreciated as we navigate the complexities of synthesizing such a wide array of knowledge.

## Documentation

Contained within are comprehensive notes and documents capturing the breadth of research, theories, and experimental insights gathered during this exploratory journey.

## Getting Started

Dive into this quantum exploration by opening the project in Obsidian. To fully engage with the material, ensure you have the recommended plugins installed (refer to the plugin folder). Be aware that you must insert your own API keys into the `data.json` files, wich are .gitignored.

## Scrapper

The Scrapper is an instrumental tool in our quest to amalgamate data from across the digital expanse. This utility is adept at extracting the essence of any webpage provided to it, employing a chosen parser to sift through the data, and meticulously cataloging the findings into a designated file.

### How to Unleash the Scrapper

Embark on your data expedition by:

1. Initializing the environment with `npm install`.
2. Deploying the Scrapper with `npm run scrapper`.

Ensure you wield the right to harvest from your targeted URL, and that your parameters for the URL, parser, and filename are precisely defined in the `scrapper.js` file. Should you navigate into uncharted territories or face any anomalies, the root README is your compass, and the project guardians are but a message away for guidance.
