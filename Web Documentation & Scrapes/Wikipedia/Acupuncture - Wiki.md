In traditional acupuncture, the acupuncturist decides which points to treat by observing and questioning the patient to make a diagnosis according to the tradition used. In TCM, the four diagnostic methods are: inspection, auscultation and olfaction, inquiring, and palpation. Inspection focuses on the face and particularly on the tongue, including analysis of the tongue size, shape, tension, color and coating, and the absence or presence of teeth marks around the edge.<ref name=Cheng1987/> Auscultation and olfaction involve listening for particular sounds such as wheezing, and observing body odor.<ref name=Cheng1987/> Inquiring involves focusing on the "seven inquiries": chills and fever; perspiration; appetite, thirst and taste; defecation and urination; pain; sleep; and [[menses]] and [[leukorrhea]].<ref name=Cheng1987/> Palpation is focusing on feeling the body for tender ''"A-shi"'' points and feeling the pulse.<ref name=Cheng1987>[[#Cheng1987|Cheng]], 1987, chapter 12.</ref>

=== Needles ===
[[File:Acupuncture Needles.jpg|thumb|right|Acupuncture needles]]
[[File:Japanese kudabari.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional and modern Japanese guiding tube needles]]

The most common mechanism of stimulation of acupuncture points employs penetration of the skin by thin metal needles, which are manipulated manually or the needle may be further stimulated by electrical stimulation (electroacupuncture).<ref name=Berman2010/> Acupuncture needles are typically made of stainless steel, making them flexible and preventing them from rusting or breaking.<ref name=Hicks2005/> Needles are usually disposed of after each use to prevent contamination.<ref name=Hicks2005/> Reusable needles when used should be sterilized between applications.<ref name=Hicks2005>{{cite book | first = Angela | last = Hicks | name-list-style = vanc |edition=1 |page=41 |title=The Acupuncture Handbook: How Acupuncture Works and How It Can Help You |publisher=[[Piatkus Books]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-0749924720}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Collinge |first=William J. |name-list-style=vanc |title=The American Holistic Health Association Complete guide to alternative medicine |publisher=Warner Books |location=New York |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-446-67258-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/americanholistic00coll }}</ref> In many areas, only sterile, single-use acupuncture needles are allowed, including the State of California, USA.<ref>Department of Consumer Affairs, California Acupuncture Board.

Apart from the usual filiform needle, other needle types include three-edged needles and the Nine Ancient Needles.<ref name=Aung116/> Japanese acupuncturists use extremely thin needles that are used superficially, sometimes without penetrating the skin, and surrounded by a guide tube (a 17th-century invention adopted in China and the West).

=== Needling technique ===

==== Insertion ====

The skin is sterilized and needles are inserted, frequently with a plastic guide tube. Needles may be manipulated in various ways, including spinning, flicking, or moving up and down relative to the skin. Since most pain is felt in the superficial layers of the skin, a quick insertion of the needle is recommended.<ref name=Aung2007>[[#Aung2007|Aung & Chen]], 2007, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=I6NclaeDWjgC&pg=PA113 113–14].</ref> Often the needles are stimulated by hand in order to cause a dull, localized, aching sensation that is called ''de qi'', as well as "needle grasp," a tugging feeling felt by the acupuncturist and generated by a mechanical interaction between the needle and skin.<ref name=Berman2010/> Acupuncture can be painful.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Loyeung BY, Cobbin DM | title = Investigating the effects of three needling parameters (manipulation, retention time, and insertion site) on needling sensation and pain profiles: a study of eight deep needling interventions | journal = Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine | volume = 2013 | pages = 1–12 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24159337 | pmc = 3789497 | doi = 10.1155/2013/136763 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The acupuncturist's skill level may influence the painfulness of the needle insertion; a sufficiently skilled practitioner may be able to insert the needles without causing any pain.<ref name=Aung2007/>

==== ''De-qi'' sensation ====

''De-qi'' ({{zh|s=得气|p=dé qì}}; "arrival of qi") refers to a claimed sensation of numbness, distension, or electrical tingling at the needling site. If these sensations are not observed then inaccurate location of the [[acupoint]], improper depth of needle insertion, inadequate manual manipulation, are blamed. If ''de-qi'' is not immediately observed upon needle insertion, various manual manipulation techniques are often applied to promote it (such as "plucking", "shaking" or "trembling").<ref name="AungChen2007">{{cite book | first1 = Steven | last1 = Aung | first2 = William | last2 = Chen | name-list-style = vanc |title=Clinical Introduction to Medical Acupuncture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I6NclaeDWjgC|year=2007|publisher=Thieme|isbn=978-1588902214|page=116}}</ref>

Once ''de-qi'' is observed, techniques might be used which attempt to "influence" the ''de-qi''; for example, by certain manipulation the ''de-qi'' can allegedly be conducted from the needling site towards more distant sites of the body.<!---is this threading?---> Other techniques aim at "tonifying" ({{zh|s=补|p=bǔ}}) or "sedating" ({{zh|s=泄|p=xiè}}) ''qi''.<ref name="AungChen2007"/> The former techniques are used in [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Eight principles of diagnosis|deficiency]] patterns, the latter in excess patterns.<ref name="AungChen2007"/> ''De qi'' is more important in Chinese acupuncture, while Western and Japanese patients may not consider it a necessary part of the treatment.<ref name=Dummies/>

==== Chinese, Korean, and Japanese-language ====

A 2010 systematic review of the Chinese-language literature found numerous acupuncture-related adverse events, including pneumothorax, fainting, [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]], and infection as the most frequent, and cardiovascular injuries, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pneumothorax, and recurrent cerebral hemorrhage as the most serious, most of which were due to improper technique.<ref name=Zhang-2010/> Between 1980 and 2009, the Chinese-language literature reported 479 adverse events.<ref name=Zhang-2010/> [[Prospective survey]]s show that mild, transient acupuncture-associated adverse events ranged from 6.71% to 15%.<ref name=Zhang-2010/> In a study with 190,924 patients, the prevalence of serious adverse events was roughly 0.024%.<ref name=Zhang-2010/> Another study showed a rate of adverse events requiring specific treatment of 2.2%, 4,963 [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidences]] among 229,230 patients.<ref name=Zhang-2010/> Infections, mainly [[hepatitis]], after acupuncture are reported often in English-language research, though are rarely reported in Chinese-language research, making it plausible that acupuncture-associated infections have been underreported in China.<ref name=Zhang-2010/> Infections were mostly caused by poor sterilization of acupuncture needles.<ref name=Zhang-2010/> Other adverse events included spinal epidural hematoma (in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine), chylothorax, injuries of abdominal organs and tissues, injuries in the neck region, injuries to the eyes, including orbital hemorrhage, traumatic cataract, injury of the oculomotor nerve and retinal puncture, hemorrhage to the cheeks and the hypoglottis, peripheral motor-nerve injuries and subsequent motor dysfunction, local allergic reactions to metal needles, stroke, and cerebral hemorrhage after acupuncture.<ref name=Zhang-2010/>

==== Children and pregnancy ====

Although acupuncture has been practiced for thousands of years in China, its use in [[pediatrics]] in the United States did not become common until the early 2000s. In 2007, the [[National Health Interview Survey]] (NHIS) conducted by the [[National Center for Health Statistics|National Center For Health Statistics]] (NCHS) estimated that approximately 150,000 children had received acupuncture treatment for a variety of conditions.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://nccih.nih.gov/sites/nccam.nih.gov/files/news/nhsr12.pdf |title = Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use Among Adults and Children: United States, 2007 |date = 10 December 2008 |website = National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health |publisher = NCHS |last = Barnes |first = Patricia M. |access-date = 5 February 2016 |archive-date = 16 March 2016 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160316075748/https://nccih.nih.gov/sites/nccam.nih.gov/files/news/nhsr12.pdf |url-status = live }}</ref>

In 2008 a study determined that the use of acupuncture-needle treatment on children was "questionable" due to the possibility of adverse side-effects and the pain manifestation differences in children versus adults. The study also includes warnings against practicing acupuncture on infants, as well as on children who are over-fatigued, very weak, or have over-eaten.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jindal V, Ge A, Mansky PJ | title = Safety and efficacy of acupuncture in children: a review of the evidence | journal = Journal of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology | volume = 30 | issue = 6 | pages = 431–42 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18525459 | pmc = 2518962 | doi = 10.1097/MPH.0b013e318165b2cc }}</ref>

When used on children, acupuncture is considered safe when administered by well-trained, licensed practitioners using sterile needles; however, a 2011 review found there was limited research to draw definite conclusions about the overall safety of pediatric acupuncture.<ref name="Adams 2011"/> The same review found 279 adverse events, 25 of them serious.<ref name="Adams 2011"/> The adverse events were mostly mild in nature (e.g. bruising or bleeding).<ref name="Adams 2011"/> The prevalence of mild adverse events ranged from 10.1% to 13.5%, an estimated 168 incidences among 1,422 patients.<ref name="Adams 2011"/> On rare occasions adverse events were serious (e.g. [[cardiac rupture]] or [[hemoptysis]]); many might have been a result of substandard practice.<ref name="Adams 2011">{{cite journal | vauthors = Adams D, Cheng F, Jou H, Aung S, Yasui Y, Vohra S | s2cid = 46502395 | title = The safety of pediatric acupuncture: a systematic review | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 128 | issue = 6 | pages = e1575–87 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22106073 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2011-1091 }}</ref> The incidence of serious adverse events was 5 per one million, which included children and adults.<ref name="Adams 2011"/>

When used during pregnancy, the majority of adverse events caused by acupuncture were mild and transient, with few serious adverse events.<ref name="Park-2014"/> The most frequent mild adverse event was needling or unspecified pain, followed by bleeding.<ref name="Park-2014"/> Although two deaths (one stillbirth and one neonatal death) were reported, there was a lack of acupuncture-associated maternal mortality.<ref name="Park-2014"/> Limiting the evidence as certain, probable or possible in the causality evaluation, the estimated incidence of adverse events following acupuncture in pregnant women was 131 per 10,000.<ref name="Park-2014">

Although acupuncture is not contraindicated in pregnant women, some specific acupuncture points are particularly sensitive to needle insertion; these spots, as well as the [[abdomen|abdominal region]], should be avoided during pregnancy.<ref name="Berman2010"/>

==== Moxibustion and cupping ====
<!-- Traditional acupuncture involves moxibustion and cupping. -->
Four adverse events associated with moxibustion were bruising, burns and cellulitis, spinal epidural abscess, and large superficial basal cell carcinoma.<ref name="Xu S"/> Ten adverse events were associated with cupping.<ref name="Xu S"/> The minor ones were [[keloid]] scarring, burns, and [[bulla (dermatology)|bullae]];<ref name="Xu S"/> the serious ones were acquired hemophilia A, stroke following cupping on the back and neck, factitious [[panniculitis]], reversible cardiac hypertrophy, and [[iron deficiency anemia]].<ref name="Xu S"/>

Acupressure therapy was prevalent in India. Once [[Chinese Buddhism#Han Dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE)|Buddhism spread to China]], the acupressure therapy was also integrated into common medical practice in China and it came to be known as acupuncture. The major points of Indian acupressure and Chinese acupuncture are similar to each other.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wGQUBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA27|page=27|author=Joseph S.

According to an article in ''Rheumatology'', the first documentation of an "organized system of diagnosis and treatment" for acupuncture was in ''Inner Classic of Huang Di'' ([[Huangdi Neijing]]) from about 100&nbsp;BC.<ref name=White-Ernst/> Gold and silver needles found in the tomb of [[Liu Sheng, Prince of Zhongshan|Liu Sheng]] from around 100&nbsp;BC are believed to be the earliest archaeological evidence of acupuncture, though it is unclear if that was their purpose.<ref name=Ramey>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramey D, Buell D | year = 2004 | title = A true history of acupuncture | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1211/fact.2004.00244/full | doi = 10.1211/fact.2004.00244 | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | journal = Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies | pages = 269–73 | s2cid = 71106490 | trans-title = 2017-01-01 | access-date = 21 March 2014 | archive-date = 24 May 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140524190347/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1211/fact.2004.00244/full | url-status = live }}</ref> According to Plinio Prioreschi, the earliest known historical record of acupuncture is the [[Shiji]] ("Records of the Grand Historian"), written by a historian around 100&nbsp;BC.<ref name="Prioreschi2004"/> It is believed that this text was documenting what was established practice at that time.<ref name=White-Ernst/>

Acupuncture may have been practised during the [[Neolithic]] era, near the end of the [[Stone Age]], using sharpened stones called [[Bian Stones|Bian shi]].<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|70}} Many Chinese texts from later eras refer to sharp stones called "plen", which means "stone probe", that may have been used for acupuncture purposes.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|70}} The ancient Chinese medical text, Huangdi Neijing, indicates that sharp stones were believed at-the-time to cure illnesses at or near the body's surface, perhaps because of the short depth a stone could penetrate.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|71}} However, it is more likely that stones were used for other medical purposes, such as puncturing a growth to drain its [[pus]].<ref name=White-Ernst/><ref name="Porter 2013 p. 403"/> The ''[[Mawangdui]]'' texts, which are believed to be from the 2nd century BC, mention the use of pointed stones to open [[abscess]]es, and moxibustion, but not for acupuncture.<ref name="Prioreschi2004"/> It is also speculated that these stones may have been used for bloodletting, due to the ancient Chinese belief that illnesses were caused by demons within the body that could be killed or released.<ref name="Singh Ernst 2008 p. 42">{{cite book | vauthors=Singh S, Ernst E | title=Trick Or Treatment: The Undeniable Facts about Alternative Medicine | publisher=W.

According to historians [[Lu Gwei-djen]] and [[Joseph Needham]], there is substantial evidence that acupuncture may have begun around 600&nbsp;BC.<ref name="abc"/> Some hieroglyphs and [[Pictogram|pictographs]] from that era suggests acupuncture and moxibustion were practised.<ref name="Robson">{{cite book | last = Robson | first = T | title = An Introduction to Complementary Medicine | isbn = 978-1741140545 | year = 2004 | publisher = [[Allen & Unwin]] | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E6oa37ZyTxEC&pg=PA90 | page = 90 }}</ref> However, historians Lu and Needham said it was unlikely a needle could be made out of the materials available in China during this time period.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|71–72}} It is possible that [[bronze]] was used for early acupuncture needles.

====Belief systems====
Several different and sometimes conflicting belief systems emerged regarding acupuncture. This may have been the result of competing schools of thought.<ref name=White-Ernst/> Some ancient texts referred to using acupuncture to cause bleeding, while others mixed the ideas of blood-letting and spiritual ch'i energy. Over time, the focus shifted from blood to the concept of puncturing specific points on the body, and eventually to balancing Yin and Yang energies as well.<ref name="Prioreschi2004"/> According to David Ramey, no single "method or theory" was ever predominantly adopted as the standard.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramey DW | title = Inaccurate acupuncture history | journal = Rheumatology | volume = 43 | issue = 12 | pages = 1593; author reply 1593–94 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15564643 | doi = 10.1093/rheumatology/keh363 | doi-access = free }}</ref> At the time, scientific knowledge of medicine was not yet developed, especially because in China dissection of the deceased was forbidden, preventing the development of basic anatomical knowledge.<ref name=White-Ernst/>

It is not certain when specific acupuncture points were introduced, but the autobiography of [[Bian Que]] from around 400–500&nbsp;BC references inserting needles at designated areas.<ref name="abc"/> Bian Que believed there was a single acupuncture point at the top of one's skull that he called the point "of the hundred meetings."<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|83}} Texts dated to be from 156 to 186&nbsp;BC document early beliefs in channels of life force energy called meridians that would later be an element in early acupuncture beliefs.<ref name=Ramey/>

Ramey and Buell said the "practice and theoretical underpinnings" of modern acupuncture were introduced in ''The Yellow Emperor's Classic'' (Huangdi Neijing) around 100&nbsp;BC.<ref name=Prioreschi2004>{{cite book | last = Prioreschi | first = P | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=MJUMhEYGOKsC&pg=PA147 147–48] | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-1888456011 | publisher = Horatius Press | title = A history of Medicine, Volume 2 }}</ref><ref name=Ramey/> It introduced the concept of using acupuncture to manipulate the flow of life energy (''qi'') in a network of meridian (channels) in the body.<ref name=Ramey/><ref name="Epler">{{cite journal | vauthors = Epler DC | title = Bloodletting in early Chinese medicine and its relation to the origin of acupuncture | journal = Bulletin of the History of Medicine | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 337–67 | year = 1980 | pmid = 6998524 }}</ref> The network concept was made up of acu-tracts, such as a line down the arms, where it said acupoints were located.

===Early development in China===

====Establishment and growth====
In the first half of the 1st century AD, acupuncturists began promoting the belief that acupuncture's effectiveness was influenced by the time of day or night, the lunar cycle, and the season.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|140–41}} The 'science of the yin-yang cycles' ({{lang|zh|運氣學}} {{transliteration|zh|yùn qì xué}}{{efn|A reference to the five movements and six ''qi'' ({{lang|zh|五運六氣}} {{transliteration|zh|wǔ yùn liù qì}}).}}) was a set of beliefs that curing diseases relied on the alignment of both heavenly (''tian'') and earthly (''di'') forces that were attuned to cycles like that of the sun and moon.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|140–41}} There were several different belief systems that relied on a number of celestial and earthly bodies or elements that rotated and only became aligned at certain times.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|140–41}} According to Needham and Lu, these "arbitrary predictions" were depicted by acupuncturists in complex charts and through a set of special terminology.<ref name="abc"/>

Acupuncture needles during this period were much thicker than most modern ones and often resulted in infection. Infection is caused by a lack of sterilization, but at that time it was believed to be caused by use of the wrong needle, or needling in the wrong place, or at the wrong time.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|102–03}} Later, many needles were heated in boiling water, or in a flame. Sometimes needles were used while they were still hot, creating a [[cauterizing]] effect at the injection site.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|104}} Nine needles were recommended in the ''Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion''{{efn|{{zh|t=針灸大成|s=针灸大成|p=Zhēn jiǔ dà chéng|w=Chen Chiu Ta Chʻeng}}.}} from 1601, which may have been because of an ancient Chinese belief that nine was a magic number.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|102–03}}

Other belief systems were based on the idea that the human body operated on a rhythm and acupuncture had to be applied at the right point in the rhythm to be effective.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|140–41}} In some cases a lack of balance between Yin and Yang were believed to be the cause of disease.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|140–41}}

In the 1st century AD, many of the first books about acupuncture were published and recognized acupuncturist experts began to emerge. The ''Zhen Jiu Jia Yi Jing'',{{efn|{{zh|t=針灸甲乙經|s=针灸甲乙经|p=Zhēn jiǔ jiǎ yǐ jīng}}.}} which was published in the mid-3rd century, became the oldest acupuncture book that is still in existence in the modern era.<ref name="abc"/> Other books like the ''Yu Gui Zhen Jing'',{{efn|{{zh|t=玉匱鍼經|s=玉匮针经|p=Yù guì zhēn jīng|w=Yü Kuei Chen Ching}}.}} written by the Director of Medical Services for China, were also influential during this period, but were not preserved.<ref name="abc"/> In the mid 7th century, [[Sun Simiao]] published acupuncture-related diagrams and charts that established standardized methods for finding acupuncture sites on people of different sizes and categorized acupuncture sites in a set of modules.<ref name="abc"/>

Korea is believed to be the first country in Asia that acupuncture spread to outside of China.<ref name="abc"/> Within Korea there is a legend that acupuncture was developed by emperor [[Dangun]], though it is more likely to have been brought into Korea from a Chinese colonial prefecture in 514&nbsp;AD.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|262–63}} Acupuncture use was commonplace in Korea by the 6th century. It spread to Vietnam in the 8th and 9th centuries.<ref name="Porter 2013 p. 403"/> As Vietnam began trading with Japan and China around the 9th century, it was influenced by their acupuncture practices as well.<ref name=White-Ernst/> China and Korea sent "medical missionaries" that spread traditional Chinese medicine to Japan, starting around 219&nbsp;AD. In 553, several Korean and Chinese citizens were appointed to re-organize medical education in Japan and they incorporated acupuncture as part of that system.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|264}} Japan later sent students back to China and established acupuncture as one of five divisions of the Chinese State Medical Administration System.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|264–65}}

Acupuncture began to spread to Europe in the second half of the 17th century. Around this time the surgeon-general of the [[Dutch East India Company]] met Japanese and Chinese acupuncture practitioners and later encouraged Europeans to further investigate it.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|264–65}} He published the first in-depth description of acupuncture for the European audience and created the term "acupuncture" in his 1683 work ''De Acupunctura''.<ref name="Singh Ernst 2008 p. 42"/> France was an early adopter among the West due to the influence of Jesuit missionaries, who brought the practice to French clinics in the 16th century.<ref name=White-Ernst/> The French doctor Louis Berlioz (the father of the composer [[Hector Berlioz]]) is usually credited with being the first to experiment with the procedure in Europe in 1810, before publishing his findings in 1816.<ref name=Barnes2005/>{{rp|308}}

By the 19th century, acupuncture had become commonplace in many areas of the world.<ref name=abc/>{{RP|295}} Americans and Britons began showing interest in acupuncture in the early 19th century, although interest waned by mid-century.<ref name=White-Ernst/> Western practitioners abandoned acupuncture's traditional beliefs in spiritual energy, [[pulse diagnosis]], and the cycles of the moon, sun or the body's rhythm. Diagrams of the flow of spiritual energy, for example, conflicted with the West's own anatomical diagrams. It adopted a new set of ideas for acupuncture based on tapping needles into nerves.<ref name=White-Ernst/><ref name="Porter 2013 p. 403"/><ref name="Jackson 2011 p. 610"/> In Europe it was speculated that acupuncture may allow or prevent the flow of electricity in the body, as electrical pulses were found to make a frog's leg twitch after death.<ref name="Singh Ernst 2008 p. 42"/>

The West eventually created a belief system based on Travell trigger points that were believed to inhibit pain. They were in the same locations as China's spiritually identified acupuncture points, but under a different nomenclature.<ref name=White-Ernst/> The first elaborate Western treatise on acupuncture was published in 1683 by [[Willem ten Rhijne]].<ref name=Barnes2005/>{{rp|75}}

In China, the popularity of acupuncture rebounded in 1949 when [[Mao Zedong]] took power and sought to unite China behind traditional cultural values. It was also during this time that many Eastern medical practices were consolidated under the name traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).<ref name="Porter 2013 p. 403"/>

==Regulation==
{{Main|Regulation of acupuncture}}
There are various government and trade association regulatory bodies for acupuncture in the United Kingdom, the United States, Saudi Arabia, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Canada, and in European countries and elsewhere. The [[World Health Organization]] recommends that before being licensed or certified, an acupuncturist receive 200 hours of specialized training if they are a physician and 2,500 hours for non-physicians; many governments have adopted similar standards.

In Hong Kong, the practice of acupuncture is regulated by the Chinese Medicine Council that was formed in 1999 by the Legislative Council. It includes a licensing exam and registration, as well as degree courses approved by the board.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hong Kong's traditional Chinese medicine laws 'putting public at risk'|date=23 July 2007|first=Mark|last=O'Neill|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/601500/hong-kongs-traditional-chinese-medicine-laws-putting-public-risk|newspaper=South China Morning Post|access-date=14 May 2015|archive-date=19 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519083803/http://www.scmp.com/article/601500/hong-kongs-traditional-chinese-medicine-laws-putting-public-risk|url-status=live}}</ref> Canada has acupuncture licensing programs in the provinces of British Columbia, Ontario, Alberta and Quebec; standards set by the Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture Association of Canada are used in provinces without government regulation.<ref name="Ramsay2009">{{cite book|first=Cynthia|last=Ramsay|name-list-style=vanc|title=Unnatural Regulation: Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy in Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Y5oPvK4QVwC&pg=PA43|year=2009|publisher=The Fraser Institute|page=43|id=GGKEY:0KK0XUSQASK|access-date=27 January 2016|archive-date=15 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230415012412/https://books.google.com/books?id=4Y5oPvK4QVwC&pg=PA43|url-status=live}}</ref> Regulation in the US began in the 1970s in California, which was eventually followed by every state but Wyoming and Idaho.
