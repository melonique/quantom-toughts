A '''placebo''' ({{IPAc-en|p|l|ə|ˈ|s|iː|b|oʊ}} {{respell|plə|SEE|boh}}) can be roughly defined as a [[Wikt:sham|sham]] medical treatment.<ref name=aspmn/> Common placebos include inert tablets (like sugar pills), inert injections (like [[Saline (medicine)|saline]]), [[sham surgery]],<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304680904579365414108916816 | title=The FDA Wants You for Sham Surgery | work=Wall Street Journal | date=18 February 2014 | access-date=8 January 2015 | last = Gottlieb | first = Scott }}</ref> and other procedures.<ref name="Lanotte">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lanotte M, Lopiano L, Torre E, Bergamasco B, Colloca L, Benedetti F | title = Expectation enhances autonomic responses to stimulation of the human subthalamic limbic region | journal = Brain, Behavior, and Immunity | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 500–509 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16055306 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbi.2005.06.004 | s2cid = 36092163 }}</ref>

Placebos are used in [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized clinical trials]] to test the efficacy of [[Drug|medical treatments]], so they serve as epistemological tools to screen out the ‘noise’ of clinical research. Placebos in clinical trials should ideally be indistinguishable from so-called verum treatments under investigation, except for the latter’s particular hypothesized remedial factor(s).<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Blease |first1=Charlotte |last2=Annoni |first2=Marco |date=April 2019 |title=Overcoming disagreement: a roadmap for placebo studies |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331766597 |journal=Biology & Philosophy |language=en |volume=34 |issue=2 |doi=10.1007/s10539-019-9671-5 |issn=0169-3867}}</ref> This is to [[blinded experiment|prevent the recipient or others from knowing]] (with their [[consent]]) whether a treatment is active or inactive, as expectations about [[efficacy]] can influence results.<ref>{{cite web |date=9 April 2016 |title=placebo |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/placebo |access-date=21 January 2017 |work=Dictionary.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=placebo |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/placebo |access-date=21 January 2017 |work=TheFreeDictionary.com}}</ref>

Placebos are also popular because they can sometimes produce relief through psychological mechanisms (a phenomenon known as the "placebo effect"). They can affect how patients perceive their condition and encourage the body's chemical processes for relieving pain<ref name="acs" /> and a few other symptoms,<ref name="quattrone-barbagallo" /> but have no impact on the [[disease]] itself.<ref name="CochraneHrob2010" /><ref name="acs" />

Improvements that patients experience after being treated with a placebo can also be due to unrelated factors, such as [[regression to the mean]] (a statistical effect where an unusually high or low measurement is likely to be followed by a less extreme one).<ref name="acs" /> The use of placebos in clinical medicine raises ethical concerns, especially if they are disguised as an active treatment, as this introduces dishonesty into the doctor–patient relationship and bypasses [[informed consent]].<ref name="Newman">{{cite book | first = David H. | last = Newman |title=Hippocrates' Shadow |publisher=Scribner |year=2008| pages=134–159 |isbn=978-1-4165-5153-9}}</ref>

In a [[Placebo-controlled study|placebo-controlled]] [[clinical trial]] any change in the [[scientific control|control]] group is known as the '''placebo response''', and the difference between this and the result of no treatment is the '''placebo effect'''.<ref name="chaplin" /> Some researchers now recommend comparing the experimental treatment with an existing treatment when possible, instead of a placebo.<ref name="michels" />

The idea of a ''placebo effect''—a therapeutic outcome derived from an inert treatment—was discussed in 18th century psychology,<ref>Schwarz, K. A., & Pfister, R.: ''Scientific psychology in the 18th century: a historical rediscovery.'' In: ''Perspectives on Psychological Science'', Nr. 11, pp. 399–407.</ref> but became more prominent in the 20th century. An influential 1955 study entitled ''The Powerful Placebo'' firmly established the idea that placebo effects were clinically important,<ref name="Hrob2001">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hróbjartsson A, Gøtzsche PC | title = Is the placebo powerless?

A 1997 reassessment found no evidence of any placebo effect in the source data, as the study had not accounted for [[regression to the mean]].<ref name="Kienle & Kiene" /><ref name=Hrob2004/>

==Etymology==
''Placebo'' (pronounced /plaˈkebo/ or /plaˈt͡ʃebo) is [[Latin]] for [''I] shall be pleasing.'' It was used as a name for the [[Vespers]] in the [[Office of the Dead]], taken from its [[incipit]], a quote from the [[Vulgate]]'s [[Psalm 116]]:9, ''placēbō Dominō in regiōne vīvōrum'', "[I] shall please the Lord in the land of the living."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Placebo (origins of technical term)|url=https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Placebo+(origins+of+technical+term)|access-date=2021-02-07|website=TheFreeDictionary.com}}</ref><ref>{{Bibleverse|Psalms|114:9}}</ref><ref name=Jacobs00>{{cite journal |author=Jacobs B |title=Biblical origins of placebo |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=213–214 |date=April 2000 |pmid=10844895 |pmc=1297986 |doi=10.1177/014107680009300419 }}</ref> From that, a ''singer of placebo'' became associated with someone who falsely claimed a connection to the deceased to get a share of the funeral meal, and hence a flatterer, and so a deceptive act to please.<ref name="Shapiro"/>

==Definitions==
The definition of "placebo" has been debated.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Blease |first1=Charlotte |last2=Annoni |first2=Marco |date=2019-03-14 |title=Overcoming disagreement: a roadmap for placebo studies |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10539-019-9671-5 |journal=Biology & Philosophy |language=en |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=18 |doi=10.1007/s10539-019-9671-5 |s2cid=254281187 |issn=1572-8404}}</ref> One definition states that a [[Medical treatment|treatment]] process t is a placebo when none of the ''characteristic treatment factors C'' are effective (remedial or harmful) in [[patient]] X for [[disease]] D.

In a clinical trial, a ''placebo response'' is the measured response of subjects to a placebo; the ''placebo effect'' is the difference between that response and no treatment.<ref name=chaplin>{{cite journal |year=2006 | vauthors=Chaplin S |journal=Prescriber | volume=17 | issue=5 |title=The placebo response: an important part of treatment |doi=10.1002/psb.344 |pages=16–22 | s2cid=72626022 |doi-access=free }}</ref> The placebo response may include improvements due to natural healing, declines due to natural disease progression, the tendency for people who were temporarily feeling either better or worse than usual to return to their average situations ([[regression toward the mean]]), and errors in the clinical trial records, which can make it appear that a change has happened when nothing has changed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kaptchuk|first1=Ted J|last2=Hemond|first2=Christopher C|last3=Miller|first3=Franklin G|date=2020-07-20|title=Placebos in chronic pain: evidence, theory, ethics, and use in clinical practice|journal=BMJ|volume=370|language=en|pages=m1668|doi=10.1136/bmj.m1668|pmid=32690477|s2cid=220633770|issn=1756-1833|doi-access=free}}</ref> It is also part of the recorded response to any active medical intervention.<ref name=eccles>{{cite journal | vauthors = Eccles R | title = The powerful placebo in cough studies? | journal = Pulmonary Pharmacology & Therapeutics | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 303–308 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12099783 | doi = 10.1006/pupt.2002.0364 }}</ref>

===Factors influencing the power of the placebo effect===
A review published in ''JAMA Psychiatry'' found that, in trials of antipsychotic medications, the change in response to receiving a placebo had increased significantly between 1960 and 2013. The review's authors identified several factors that could be responsible for this change, including inflation of baseline scores and enrollment of fewer severely ill patients.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rutherford BR, Pott E, Tandler JM, [[Melanie Wall|Wall MM]], Roose SP, Lieberman JA | title = Placebo response in antipsychotic clinical trials: a meta-analysis | journal = JAMA Psychiatry | volume = 71 | issue = 12 | pages = 1409–21 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25321611 | pmc = 4256120 | doi = 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2014.1319 }}</ref> Another analysis published in ''Pain'' in 2015 found that placebo responses had increased considerably in [[neuropathic pain]] clinical trials conducted in the United States from 1990 to 2013. The researchers suggested that this may be because such trials have "increased in study size and length" during this time period.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tuttle AH, Tohyama S, Ramsay T, Kimmelman J, Schweinhardt P, Bennett GJ, Mogil JS | title = Increasing placebo responses over time in U.S. clinical trials of neuropathic pain | journal = Pain | volume = 156 | issue = 12 | pages = 2616–26 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26307858 | doi = 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000333 | s2cid = 23246031 }}

A 2010 Cochrane Collaboration review suggests that placebo effects are apparent only in subjective, continuous measures, and in the treatment of pain and related conditions.<ref name="CochraneHrob2010" /> Anyway, several objective outcomes are affected as well, like [[Parkinson's disease]] symptoms,<ref name="quattrone-barbagallo" /> [[Immune system|immune]] and [[Endocrine system|endocrine]] parameters,<ref name=":1" /><ref name="Pacheco" />  end-organ functions regulated by the [[autonomic nervous system]],<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Meissner |first=Karin |date=2011-06-27 |title=The placebo effect and the autonomic nervous system: evidence for an intimate relationship |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=366 |issue=1572 |pages=1808–1817 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0403 |issn=0962-8436 |pmc=3130407 |pmid=21576138}}</ref> [[sport]] performance,<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Hurst |first1=Philip |last2=Schipof-Godart |first2=Lieke |last3=Szabo |first3=Attila |last4=Raglin |first4=John |last5=Hettinga |first5=Florentina |last6=Roelands |first6=Bart |last7=Lane |first7=Andrew |last8=Foad |first8=Abby |last9=Coleman |first9=Damian |last10=Beedie |first10=Chris |date=2020-03-15 |title=The Placebo and Nocebo effect on sports performance: A systematic review |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17461391.2019.1655098 |journal=European Journal of Sport Science |language=en |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=279–292 |doi=10.1080/17461391.2019.1655098 |pmid=31414966 |s2cid=199662279 |issn=1746-1391|hdl=2436/622641 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> and others.

====Pain====
Placebos are believed to be capable of altering a person's perception of pain. "A person might reinterpret a sharp pain as uncomfortable tingling."<ref name="acs">{{cite web|date=10 April 2015|title=Placebo Effect|url=https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/clinical-trials/placebo-effect.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200522232756/https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/clinical-trials/placebo-effect.html|archive-date=2020-05-22|access-date=2021-06-27|publisher=American Cancer Society}}</ref>

One way in which the magnitude of placebo analgesia can be measured is by conducting "open/hidden" studies, in which some patients receive an analgesic and are informed that they will be receiving it (open), while others are administered the same drug without their knowledge (hidden). Such studies have found that analgesics are considerably more effective when the patient knows they are receiving them.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Price DD, Finniss DG, Benedetti F | title = A comprehensive review of the placebo effect: recent advances and current thought | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 565–90 | date = 2008 | pmid = 17550344 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.59.113006.095941 }}</ref>

====Depression====
In 2008, a controversial meta-analysis led by psychologist [[Irving Kirsch]], analyzing data from the FDA, concluded that 82% of the response to antidepressants was accounted for by placebos.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kirsch I, Deacon BJ, Huedo-Medina TB, Scoboria A, Moore TJ, Johnson BT | title = Initial severity and antidepressant benefits: a meta-analysis of data submitted to the Food and Drug Administration | journal = PLOS Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = e45 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18303940 | pmc = 2253608 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0050045 | doi-access = free }}</ref> However, there are serious doubts about the used methods and the interpretation of the results, especially the use of 0.5 as the cut-off point for the [[effect size]].<ref name="TurnerRosenthal2008">{{cite journal | vauthors = Turner EH, Rosenthal R | title = Efficacy of antidepressants | journal = BMJ | volume = 336 | issue = 7643 | pages = 516–7 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18319297 | pmc = 2265347 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.39510.531597.80 }}</ref> A complete reanalysis and recalculation based on the same FDA data discovered that the Kirsch study had "important flaws in the calculations". The authors concluded that although a large percentage of the placebo response was due to expectancy, this was not true for the active drug. Besides confirming drug effectiveness, they found that the drug effect was not related to depression severity.<ref name="FountoulakisMöller2010">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fountoulakis KN, Möller HJ | title = Efficacy of antidepressants: a re-analysis and re-interpretation of the Kirsch data | journal = The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 405–12 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 20800012 | doi = 10.1017/S1461145710000957 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Another meta-analysis found that 79% of depressed patients receiving placebo remained well (for 12 weeks after an initial 6–8 weeks of successful therapy) compared to 93% of those receiving antidepressants. In the continuation phase however, patients on placebo relapsed significantly more often than patients on antidepressants.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Khan A, Redding N, Brown WA | title = The persistence of the placebo response in antidepressant clinical trials | journal = Journal of Psychiatric Research | volume = 42 | issue = 10 | pages = 791–6 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18036616 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2007.10.004 }}</ref>

===Negative effects===
{{main|Nocebo}}

A phenomenon opposite to the placebo effect has also been observed. When an inactive substance or treatment is administered to a recipient who has an expectation of it having a ''negative'' impact, this intervention is known as a '''nocebo''' ([[Latin]] ''nocebo'' = "I shall harm").<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nocebo|title=nocebo|access-date=22 January 2017|publisher=Mirriam-Webster Incorporated}}</ref> A '''nocebo effect''' occurs when the recipient of an inert substance reports a negative effect or a worsening of symptoms, with the outcome resulting not from the substance itself, but from negative expectations about the treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Häuser W, Hansen E, Enck P | title = Nocebo phenomena in medicine: their relevance in everyday clinical practice | journal = Deutsches Ärzteblatt International | volume = 109 | issue = 26 | pages = 459–65 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22833756 | pmc = 3401955 | doi = 10.3238/arztebl.2012.0459 }}</ref><ref name="autogenerated4">{{cite web |url=http://priory.com/medicine/Nocebo.htm |title=The Nocebo Effect |publisher=Priory.com |date=10 February 2007 |access-date=2009-07-08}}</ref>

Another negative consequence is that placebos can cause [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effects]] associated with real treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Shapiro AK, Chassan J, Morris LA, Frick R |year=1974 |title=Placebo induced side effects |journal=Journal of Operational Psychiatry |volume=6 |pages=43–6 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/?fa=main.doiLanding&uid=1977-04006-001 }}</ref>

Withdrawal symptoms can also occur after placebo treatment. This was found, for example, after the discontinuation of the [[Women's Health Initiative]] study of [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] for [[menopause]]. Women had been on placebo for an average of 5.7 years. Moderate or severe [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms were reported by 4.8% of those on placebo compared to 21.3% of those on hormone replacement.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ockene JK, Barad DH, Cochrane BB, Larson JC, Gass M, Wassertheil-Smoller S, Manson JE, Barnabei VM, Lane DS, Brzyski RG, Rosal MC, Wylie-Rosett J, Hays J | title = Symptom experience after discontinuing use of estrogen plus progestin | journal = JAMA | volume = 294 | issue = 2 | pages = 183–93 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 16014592 | doi = 10.1001/jama.294.2.183 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

==Ethics==
{{see also|Medical ethics|Philosophy of medicine}}

===In research trials===
Knowingly giving a person a placebo when there is an effective treatment available is a bioethically complex issue. While placebo-controlled trials might provide information about the effectiveness of a treatment, it denies some patients what could be the best available (if unproven) treatment. [[Informed consent]] is usually required for a study to be considered ethical, including the disclosure that some test subjects will receive placebo treatments.

The ethics of placebo-controlled studies have been debated in the revision process of the [[Declaration of Helsinki]]. Of particular concern has been the difference between trials comparing inert placebos with experimental treatments, versus comparing the best available treatment with an experimental treatment; and differences between trials in the sponsor's developed countries versus the trial's targeted developing countries.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kottow M | title = The improper use of research placebos | journal = Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 1041–4 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20663001 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2753.2009.01246.x }}</ref>

Some suggest that existing medical treatments should be used instead of placebos, to avoid having some patients not receive medicine during the trial.<ref name="michels">{{cite journal | vauthors = Michels KB | title = The placebo problem remains | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 57 | issue = 4 | pages = 321–2 | date = April 2000 | pmid = 10768689 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.57.4.321 }}</ref>

===In medical practice===
The practice of doctors prescribing placebos that are disguised as real medication is controversial. A chief concern is that it is deceptive and could harm the doctor–patient relationship in the long run. While some say that blanket consent, or the general consent to unspecified treatment given by patients beforehand, is ethical, others argue that patients should always obtain specific information about the name of the drug they are receiving, its side effects, and other treatment options.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Asai A, Kadooka Y | title = Reexamination of the ethics of placebo use in clinical practice | journal = Bioethics | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 186–93 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 22296589 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8519.2011.01943.x | s2cid = 11300075 }}</ref> This view is shared by some on the grounds of [[Autonomy#Medicine|patient autonomy]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chua SJ, Pitts M | title = The ethics of prescription of placebos to patients with major depressive disorder | journal = Chinese Medical Journal | volume = 128 | issue = 11 | pages = 1555–7 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26021517 | doi = 10.4103/0366-6999.157699 | pmc = 4733778 | doi-access = free }}</ref> There are also concerns that legitimate doctors and pharmacists could open themselves up to charges of fraud or malpractice by using a placebo.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Malani|first1=Anup |title=Regulation with Placebo Effects|journal=Chicago Unbound|date=2008|volume=58|issue=3 |pages=411–72 |pmid=19353835 |url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2640&context=journal_articles|access-date=30 March 2018}}</ref> Critics also argued that using placebos can delay the proper diagnosis and treatment of serious medical conditions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Altunç U, Pittler MH, Ernst E | title = Homeopathy for childhood and adolescence ailments: systematic review of randomized clinical trials | journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings | volume = 82 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–75 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17285788 | doi = 10.4065/82.1.69 }}</ref>

Despite the abovementioned issues, 60% of surveyed physicians and head nurses reported using placebos in an Israeli study, with only 5% of respondents stating that placebo use should be strictly prohibited.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Nitzan|first1=Uriel|last2=Lichtenberg|first2=Pesach|date=2004-10-23|title=Questionnaire survey on use of placebo|journal=BMJ: British Medical Journal|volume=329|issue=7472|pages=944–946|doi=10.1136/bmj.38236.646678.55|issn=0959-8138|pmid=15377572|pmc=524103|doi-access=free}}</ref> A ''British Medical Journal'' editorial said, "that a patient gets pain relief from a placebo does not imply that the pain is not real or organic in origin{{Spaces}}...the use of the placebo for 'diagnosis' of whether or not pain is real is misguided."<ref name="Spiegel">{{cite journal|vauthors=Spiegel D|date=October 2004|title=Placebos in practice|journal=BMJ|volume=329|issue=7472|pages=927–8|doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7472.927|pmc=524090|pmid=15499085}}</ref> A survey in the United States of more than 10,000 physicians came to the result that while 24% of physicians would prescribe a treatment that is a placebo simply because the patient wanted treatment, 58% would not, and for the remaining 18%, it would depend on the circumstances.<ref name=kane>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/731485_7 Doctors Struggle With Tougher-Than-Ever Dilemmas: Other Ethical Issues] Author: Leslie Kane. 11/11/2010</ref>

Referring specifically to [[homeopathy]], the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] Science and Technology Committee has stated:{{Blockquote|In the Committee's view, homeopathy is a placebo treatment and the Government should have a policy on prescribing placebos. The Government is reluctant to address the appropriateness and ethics of prescribing placebos to patients, which usually relies on some degree of patient deception. Prescribing of placebos is not consistent with informed patient choice—which the Government claims is very important—as it means patients do not have all the information needed to make choice meaningful. A further issue is that the placebo effect is unreliable and unpredictable.<ref name=inquiry_cfm>{{cite web |author1=UK Parliamentary Committee Science |author2=Technology Committee |url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-archive/science-technology/s-t-homeopathy-inquiry/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224202602/http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-archive/science-technology/s-t-homeopathy-inquiry/ |archive-date=2012-02-24 |title=Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy }}</ref>}}

In his 2008 book ''[[Bad Science (Goldacre book)|Bad Science]]'', [[Ben Goldacre]] argues that instead of deceiving patients with placebos, doctors should use the placebo effect to enhance effective medicines.<ref name="bad-science">{{cite book | first = Ben | last = Goldacre |title=Bad Science |publisher=Fourth Estate |year=2008| chapter=5: The Placebo Effect |isbn=978-0-00-724019-7}}</ref> [[Edzard Ernst]] has argued similarly that "As a good doctor you should be able to transmit a placebo effect through the compassion you show your patients."<ref>{{cite journal | title = Empathy and ethics: five minutes with Edzard Ernst | journal = The BMJ | volume = 360 | issue = 1 | pages = k309| date = January 2018 | pmid = 29371199| doi = 10.1136/bmj.k309 | last1 = Rimmer | first1 = Abi | s2cid = 3511158 }}</ref> In an opinion piece about homeopathy, Ernst argues that it is wrong to support [[alternative medicine]] on the basis that it can make patients feel better through the placebo effect.<ref name="Ernst-homeopathy"/> His concerns are that it is deceitful and that the placebo effect is unreliable.<ref name="Ernst-homeopathy">{{cite news|title=No to homeopathy placebo | newspaper=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/feb/22/science-homeopathy-clinical-trials|date=22 February 2010|access-date=29 April 2019}}</ref> Goldacre also concludes that the placebo effect does not justify alternative medicine, arguing that unscientific medicine could lead to patients not receiving prevention advice.<ref name="bad-science"/>
Placebo researcher [[Fabrizio Benedetti]] also expresses concern over the potential for placebos to be used unethically, warning that there is an increase in "quackery" and that an "alternative industry that preys on the vulnerable" is developing.<ref name="Benedetti">{{cite journal |last1=Benedetti |first1=Fabrizio |title=The science of placebos is fuelling quackery |journal=Knowable Magazine |date=3 March 2022 |doi=10.1146/knowable-030222-3 |s2cid=247265071 |url=https://knowablemagazine.org/article/society/2022/science-placebos-fuelling-quackery |access-date=17 March 2022|doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Mechanisms==
The mechanism for how placebos could have effects is uncertain. From a sociocognitive perspective, intentional placebo response is attributed to the “ritual effect” that induces anticipation for transition to a better state.<ref>{{Citation |last1=Goli |first1=Farzad |title=The Ritual Effect: The Healing Response to Forms and Performs |date=2016 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-35092-9_5 |work=Biosemiotic Medicine |pages=117–132 |access-date= |place=Cham |publisher=Springer International Publishing |isbn=978-3-319-35091-2 |last2=Farzanegan |first2=Mahboubeh|series=Studies in Neuroscience, Consciousness and Spirituality |volume=5 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-35092-9_5 }}</ref> A placebo presented as a [[stimulant]] may trigger an effect on [[heart rhythm]] and [[blood pressure]], but when administered as a [[depressant]], the opposite effect.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Kirsch I |year=1997 |chapter=Specifying non-specifics: Psychological mechanism of the placebo effect |editor=Harrington A |title=The Placebo Effect: An Interdisciplinary Exploration |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=166–86 |isbn=978-0-674-66986-4}}</ref>

===Psychology===
[[File:"Miracle Cure!" Health Fraud Scams (8528312890).jpg|thumb|right|The subjective effects of placebos may be related to expectations, yet similar effects have been noted in open-label studies.]]

In psychology, the two main hypotheses of the placebo effect are expectancy theory and [[classical conditioning]].<ref name="podd" />

In 1985, [[Irving Kirsch]] hypothesized that placebo effects are produced by the self-fulfilling effects of response expectancies, in which the belief that one will feel different leads a person to actually feel different.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kirsch I |year=1985|title=Response expectancy as a determinant of experience and behavior|journal=American Psychologist|volume=40|issue=11|pages=1189–1202|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.40.11.1189}}</ref> According to this theory, the belief that one has received an active treatment can produce the subjective changes thought to be produced by the real treatment. Similarly, the appearance of effect can result from classical conditioning, wherein a placebo and an actual stimulus are used simultaneously until the placebo is associated with the effect from the actual stimulus.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Voudouris NJ, Peck CL, Coleman G | title = Conditioned response models of placebo phenomena: further support | journal = Pain | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 109–16 | date = July 1989 | pmid = 2780058 | doi = 10.1016/0304-3959(89)90080-8 | s2cid = 40356035 }}</ref> Both conditioning and expectations play a role in placebo effect,<ref name="podd">{{cite journal | vauthors = Stewart-Williams S, Podd J | title = The placebo effect: dissolving the expectancy versus conditioning debate | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 130 | issue = 2 | pages = 324–40 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 14979775 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.130.2.324 | s2cid = 10297875 }}</ref> and make different kinds of contributions.

Additionally, [[motivation]] may contribute to the placebo effect. The active goals of an individual changes their somatic experience by altering the detection and interpretation of expectation-congruent symptoms, and by changing the behavioral strategies a person pursues.<ref name="Geers et al">{{cite journal | vauthors = Geers AL, Weiland PE, Kosbab K, Landry SJ, Helfer SG | title = Goal activation, expectations, and the placebo effect | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 89 | issue = 2 | pages = 143–59 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16162050 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.89.2.143 }}</ref> Motivation may link to the meaning through which people experience illness and treatment.

Since 1978, it has been known that placebo analgesia depends upon the release of [[endogenous opioids]] in the brain.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Levine JD, Gordon NC, Fields HL | title = The mechanism of placebo analgesia | journal = Lancet | volume = 2 | issue = 8091 | pages = 654–7 | date = September 1978 | pmid = 80579 | doi = 10.1016/s0140-6736(78)92762-9 | s2cid = 45403755 }}</ref> Such analgesic placebos activation changes processing lower down in the brain by enhancing the descending inhibition through the periaqueductal gray on spinal [[Withdrawal reflex|nociceptive reflexes]], while the expectations of anti-analgesic nocebos acts in the opposite way to block this.<ref name="autogenerated2007"/>

Functional imaging upon placebo analgesia has been summarized as showing that the placebo response is "mediated by "top-down" processes dependent on frontal cortical areas that generate and maintain cognitive expectancies.

In conditioning, a neutral stimulus [[saccharin]] is paired in a drink with an agent that produces an unconditioned response. For example, that agent might be [[cyclophosphamide]], which causes [[immunosuppressive|immunosuppression]]. After learning this pairing, the taste of saccharin by itself is able to cause immunosuppression, as a new conditioned response via neural top-down control.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ader R, Cohen N | title = Behaviorally conditioned immunosuppression | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 333–40 | year = 1975 | pmid = 1162023 | doi = 10.1097/00006842-197507000-00007 | s2cid = 15306042 }}</ref> Such conditioning has been found to affect a diverse variety of not just basic physiological processes in the immune system but ones such as [[Serum iron|serum iron levels]], [[DNA oxidation|oxidative DNA damage]] levels, and [[insulin]] secretion.

The word placebo was used in a medicinal context in the late 18th century to describe a "commonplace method or medicine" and in 1811 it was defined as "any medicine adapted more to please than to benefit the patient". Although this definition contained a derogatory implication<ref name="Shapiro">{{cite journal |author=Shapiro AK |title=Semantics of the placebo |journal=Psychiatric Quarterly |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=653–695 |year=1968 |pmid=4891851 |doi=10.1007/BF01564309 |s2cid=2733947 |doi-access=free }}</ref> it did not necessarily imply that the remedy had no effect.<ref name="Kaptchuk">{{cite journal |author=Kaptchuk TJ |title=Powerful placebo: the dark side of the randomised controlled trial |journal=The Lancet |volume=351 |issue=9117 |pages=1722–1725 |date=June 1998 |pmid=9734904 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)10111-8 |s2cid=34023318 }}</ref>

It was recognized in the 18th and 19th centuries that drugs or remedies often were perceived to work best while they were still novel:<ref>Arthur K.

===Placebo-controlled studies===
{{main|Placebo-controlled study}}

The placebo effect makes it more difficult to evaluate new treatments. Clinical trials control for this effect by including a group of subjects that receives a sham treatment. The subjects in such trials are blinded as to whether they receive the treatment or a placebo. If a person is given a placebo under one name, and they respond, they will respond in the same way on a later occasion to that placebo under that name but not if under another.<ref name="pmid18440407">{{cite journal | vauthors = Whalley B, Hyland ME, Kirsch I | title = Consistency of the placebo effect | journal = Journal of Psychosomatic Research | volume = 64 | issue = 5 | pages = 537–541 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18440407 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2007.11.007 }}</ref>

Clinical trials are often double-blinded so that the researchers also do not know which test subjects are receiving the active or placebo treatment. The placebo effect in such clinical trials is weaker than in normal therapy since the subjects are not sure whether the treatment they are receiving is active.<ref name="autogenerated2003">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vase L, Riley JL, Price DD | title = A comparison of placebo effects in clinical analgesic trials versus studies of placebo analgesia | journal = Pain | volume = 99 | issue = 3 | pages = 443–452 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12406519 | doi = 10.1016/S0304-3959(02)00205-1 | s2cid = 21391210 }}</ref>
