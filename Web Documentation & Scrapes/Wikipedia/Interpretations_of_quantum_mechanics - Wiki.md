{{Quantum mechanics|cTopic=Interpretations}}
An '''interpretation of quantum mechanics''' is an attempt to explain how the mathematical theory of [[quantum mechanics]] might correspond to experienced [[reality]]. Although quantum mechanics has held up to rigorous and extremely precise tests in an extraordinarily broad range of experiments, there exist a number of contending schools of thought over their interpretation. These views on interpretation differ on such fundamental questions as whether quantum mechanics is [[determinism|deterministic]] or [[stochastic]], [[Principle_of_locality|local]] or [[Quantum_nonlocality|non-local]], which elements of quantum mechanics can be considered real, and what the nature of [[measurement in quantum mechanics|measurement]] is, among other matters.

While some variation of the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] is commonly presented in textbooks, many thought provoking interpretations have been developed.
Despite nearly a century of debate and experiment, no consensus has been reached among physicists and [[Philosophy of physics|philosophers of physics]] concerning which interpretation best "represents" reality.<ref>

The definition of quantum theorists' terms, such as ''[[wave function]]'' and ''[[matrix mechanics]]'', progressed through many stages. For instance, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] originally viewed the electron's wave function as its charge density smeared across space, but [[Max Born]] reinterpreted the absolute square value of the wave function as the electron's [[probability density function|probability density]] distributed across space;<ref name="jammer1974" />{{Rp|24–33}} the [[Born rule]], as it is now called, matched experiment, whereas Schrödinger's charge density view did not.

The views of several early pioneers of quantum mechanics, such as [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]], are often grouped together as the "[[Copenhagen interpretation]]", though physicists and historians of physics have argued that this terminology obscures differences between the views so designated.<ref name="jammer1974">{{cite book|last=Jammer |first=Max |author-link=Max Jammer |title=Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics: The interpretations of quantum mechanics in historical perspective |url=https://archive.org/details/philosophyofquan0000jamm |url-access=registration |year=1974 |publisher=Wiley-Interscience|isbn=9780471439585 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Camilleri|first=Kristian|date=2009-02-01|title=Constructing the Myth of the Copenhagen Interpretation|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/259149|journal=Perspectives on Science|volume=17|issue=1|pages=26–57|issn=1530-9274|doi=10.1162/posc.2009.17.1.26|s2cid=57559199}}</ref> Copenhagen-type ideas were never universally embraced, and challenges to a perceived Copenhagen orthodoxy gained increasing attention in the 1950s with the [[De Broglie–Bohm theory|pilot-wave interpretation]] of [[David Bohm]] and the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[Hugh Everett III]].<ref name="jammer1974"/><ref>{{Citation |last=Vaidman |first=Lev |title=Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics |date=2021 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2021/entries/qm-manyworlds/ |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |access-date=2023-08-25 |edition=Fall 2021 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}</ref><ref name="Tipler1994">{{cite book|author=Frank J.

Some concepts originating from studies of interpretations have found more practical application in [[quantum information science]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Barnum|first1=Howard|last2=Wehner|first2=Stephanie|last3=Wilce|first3=Alexander|date=August 2018|title=Introduction: Quantum Information Theory and Quantum Foundations|journal=[[Foundations of Physics]]|language=en|volume=48|issue=8|pages=853–856|doi=10.1007/s10701-018-0188-6|bibcode=2018FoPh...48..853B|s2cid=126293060|issn=0015-9018|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=DiVincenzo|first1=David P.|author-link=David DiVincenzo|last2=Fuchs|first2=Christopher A.|date=2019-02-01|title=Quantum foundations|journal=[[Physics Today]]|volume=72|issue=2|pages=50–51|doi=10.1063/PT.3.4141|bibcode=2019PhT....72b..50D|s2cid=241052502|issn=0031-9228|doi-access=free}}</ref>

== Nature ==
More or less, all interpretations of quantum mechanics share two qualities:
# They interpret a ''[[scientific formalism|formalism]]''—a set of equations and principles to generate predictions via input of initial conditions
# They interpret a ''[[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]''—a set of observations, including those obtained by empirical research and those obtained informally, such as humans' experience of an unequivocal world
Two qualities vary among interpretations:
# [[Epistemology]]—claims about the possibility, scope, and means toward relevant ''knowledge'' of the world
# [[Ontology]]—claims about what things, such as categories and entities, ''exist'' in the world
In [[philosophy of science]], the distinction of knowledge versus reality is termed ''[[epistemic]]'' versus ''[[ontic]]''. A general law is a ''regularity'' of outcomes (epistemic), whereas a causal mechanism may ''regulate'' the outcomes (ontic). A [[phenomenon]] can receive interpretation either ontic or epistemic. For instance, [[indeterminism]] may be attributed to limitations of human observation and perception (epistemic), or may be explained as intrinsic physical randomness (ontic). Confusing the epistemic with the ontic—if for example one were to presume that a general law actually "governs" outcomes, and that the statement of a regularity has the role of a causal mechanism—is a [[category mistake]].

In a broad sense, scientific theory can be viewed as offering [[scientific realism]]—approximately true description or explanation of the natural world—or might be perceived with antirealism. A realist stance seeks the epistemic and the ontic, whereas an antirealist stance seeks epistemic but not the ontic. In the 20th century's first half, antirealism was mainly [[logical positivism]], which sought to exclude unobservable aspects of reality from scientific theory.

{{anchor|shutup}}Since the 1950s, antirealism is more modest, usually [[instrumentalism]], permitting talk of unobservable aspects, but ultimately discarding the very question of realism and posing scientific theory as a tool to help humans make predictions, not to attain [[metaphysical]] understanding of the world. The instrumentalist view is carried by the famous quote of [[David Mermin]], "Shut up and calculate", often misattributed to [[Richard Feynman]].<ref>For a discussion of the provenance of the phrase "shut up and calculate", see {{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1768652|title=Could Feynman have said this?|journal=[[Physics Today]]|volume=57|issue=5|pages=10–11|year=2004|last1=Mermin|first1=N. David|bibcode=2004PhT....57e..10M|doi-access=}}</ref>

Other approaches to resolve conceptual problems introduce new mathematical formalism, and so propose alternative theories with their interpretations. An example is [[Bohmian mechanics]], whose empirical equivalence with the three standard formalisms—[[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]]'s [[Schrödinger equation|wave mechanics]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]]'s [[matrix mechanics]], and [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]]'s [[path integral formalism]]—has been demonstrated.

# Complementarity of proffered descriptions: [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]] holds that no set of classical physical concepts can simultaneously refer to all properties of a quantum system. For instance, wave description ''A'' and particulate description ''B'' can each describe quantum system ''S'', but not simultaneously. This implies the composition of physical properties of ''S'' does not obey the rules of classical [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]] when using [[Logical connective|propositional connectives]] (see "[[Quantum logic]]"). Like contextuality, the "origin of complementarity lies in the [[non-commutativity]] of operators" that describe quantum objects (Omnès 1999).
# Rapidly rising intricacy, far exceeding humans' present calculational capacity, as a system's size increases: since the state space of a quantum system is exponential in the number of subsystems, it is difficult to derive classical approximations.
# [[Quantum contextuality|Contextual]] behaviour of systems locally: [[Quantum contextuality]] demonstrates that classical intuitions, in which properties of a system hold definite values independent of the manner of their measurement, fail even for local systems. Also, physical principles such as [[Identity of indiscernibles|Leibniz's Principle of the identity of indiscernibles]] no longer apply in the quantum domain, signaling that most classical intuitions may be incorrect about the quantum world.

{{Main|Copenhagen interpretation}}

The [[Copenhagen interpretation]] is a collection of views about the meaning of [[quantum mechanics]] principally attributed to [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]]. It is one of the oldest attitudes towards quantum mechanics, as features of it date to the development of quantum mechanics during 1925–1927, and it remains one of the most commonly taught.<ref name="Siddiqui2017">{{cite journal |title=How diverse are physics instructors' attitudes and approaches to teaching undergraduate level quantum mechanics?|year=2017|last1=Siddiqui|first1= Shabnam|last2=Singh|first2=Chandralekha|journal=European Journal of Physics|volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=035703|doi=10.1088/1361-6404/aa6131|bibcode=2017EJPh...38c5703S|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>Bell, John S.

Features common to Copenhagen-type interpretations include the idea that quantum mechanics is intrinsically indeterministic, with probabilities calculated using the [[Born rule]], and the principle of [[Complementarity (physics)|complementarity]], which states that objects have certain pairs of complementary properties which cannot all be observed or measured simultaneously. Moreover, the act of "observing" or "measuring" an object is irreversible, no truth can be attributed to an object [[counterfactual definiteness|except according to the results of its measurement]] and, therefore, has features of [[Instrumentalism]]. Copenhagen-type interpretations hold that quantum descriptions are objective, in that they are independent of physicists' mental arbitrariness.<ref name="omnes">{{cite book |last=Omnès |first=R. |title=The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-691-03669-4 |location=Princeton, New Jersey |language=en-us |oclc=439453957 |author-link=Roland Omnès}}</ref>{{Rp|85–90}} The statistical interpretation of wavefunctions due to Max Born differs sharply from Schrödinger's original intent, which was to have a theory with continuous time evolution and in which wavefunctions directly described physical reality.<ref name="jammer1974"/>{{rp|24–33}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=Matrix Theory before Schrödinger: Philosophy, Problems, Consequences |first=Mara |last=Beller |journal=Isis |date=December 1983 |volume=74 |number=4  |pages=469–491 |doi=10.1086/353357 |jstor=232208|s2cid=121780437 }}</ref>

=== Many worlds ===
{{Main|Many-worlds interpretation}}

The [[many-worlds interpretation]] is an interpretation of quantum mechanics in which a [[universal wavefunction]] obeys the same deterministic, [[CPT symmetry|reversible]] laws at all times; in particular there is no (indeterministic and [[irreversibility|irreversible]]) [[wavefunction collapse]] associated with measurement. The phenomena associated with measurement are claimed to be explained by [[Quantum decoherence|decoherence]], which occurs when states interact with the environment. More precisely, the parts of the wavefunction describing observers become increasingly [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] with the parts of the wavefunction describing their experiments. Although all possible outcomes of experiments continue to lie in the wavefunction's support, the times at which they become correlated with observers effectively "split" the universe into mutually unobservable [[alternate histories]].

The existence of two laws for the evolution of the state vector...becomes problematical only if it is believed that the state vector is an objective property of the system...The "reduction of the wavepacket" does take place in the consciousness of the observer, not because of any unique physical process which takes place there, but only because the state is a construct of the observer and not an objective property of the physical system.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hartle | first1 = J.

=== Relational quantum mechanics ===
{{Main|Relational quantum mechanics}}

The essential idea behind [[relational quantum mechanics]], following the precedent of [[special relativity]], is that different observers may give different accounts of the same series of events: for example, to one observer at a given point in time, a system may be in a single, "collapsed" [[eigenstate]], while to another observer at the same time, it may be in a superposition of two or more states. Consequently, if quantum mechanics is to be a complete theory, relational quantum mechanics argues that the notion of "state" describes not the observed system itself, but the relationship, or correlation, between the system and its observer(s). The [[Quantum state vector|state vector]] of conventional quantum mechanics becomes a description of the correlation of some ''degrees of freedom'' in the observer, with respect to the observed system. However, it is held by relational quantum mechanics that this applies to all physical objects, whether or not they are conscious or macroscopic. Any "measurement event" is seen simply as an ordinary physical interaction, an establishment of the sort of correlation discussed above. Thus the physical content of the theory has to do not with objects themselves, but the relations between them.<ref>{{cite web

=== QBism ===
{{Main|Quantum Bayesianism}}

[[QBism]], which originally stood for "quantum Bayesianism", is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that takes an agent's actions and experiences as the central concerns of the theory. This interpretation is distinguished by its use of a [[Bayesian probability#Dutch book approach|subjective Bayesian]] account of probabilities to understand the quantum mechanical [[Born rule]] as a [[normative]] addition to good decision-making. QBism draws from the fields of [[quantum information]] and [[Bayesian probability]] and aims to eliminate the interpretational conundrums that have beset quantum theory.

QBism deals with common questions in the interpretation of quantum theory about the nature of [[wavefunction]] [[Quantum superposition|superposition]], [[Measurement problem|quantum measurement]], and [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]].<ref name=":21">{{cite journal|last=Timpson|first=Christopher Gordon|year=2008|title=Quantum Bayesianism: A study|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~bras2317/qb_s.ps|format=postscript|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics|volume=39|issue=3|pages=579–609|arxiv=0804.2047|doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2008.03.006|bibcode=2008SHPMP..39..579T|s2cid=16775153}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mermin|first=N.

=== Consistent histories ===
{{Main|Consistent histories}}

The [[consistent histories]] interpretation generalizes the conventional Copenhagen interpretation and attempts to provide a natural interpretation of [[quantum cosmology]]. The theory is based on a consistency criterion that allows the history of a system to be described so that the probabilities for each history obey the additive rules of classical probability. It is claimed to be [[consistent]] with the [[Schrödinger equation]].

According to this interpretation, the purpose of a quantum-mechanical theory is to predict the relative probabilities of various alternative histories (for example, of a particle).

=== Ensemble interpretation ===
{{Main|Ensemble interpretation}}

The [[ensemble interpretation]], also called the statistical interpretation, can be viewed as a minimalist interpretation. That is, it claims to make the fewest assumptions associated with the standard mathematics. It takes the statistical interpretation of Born to the fullest extent. The interpretation states that the wave function does not apply to an individual system{{spaced ndash}}for example, a single particle{{spaced ndash}}but is an abstract statistical quantity that only applies to an ensemble (a vast multitude) of similarly prepared systems or particles. In the words of Einstein:

{{Blockquote|The attempt to conceive the quantum-theoretical description as the complete description of the individual systems leads to unnatural theoretical interpretations, which become immediately unnecessary if one accepts the interpretation that the description refers to ensembles of systems and not to individual systems.|Einstein in ''Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist'', ed. P.A. Schilpp (Harper & Row, New York)}}

The most prominent current advocate of the ensemble interpretation is Leslie E. Ballentine, professor at [[Simon Fraser University]], author of the text book ''Quantum Mechanics, A Modern Development''.

=== De Broglie–Bohm theory ===
{{Main|De Broglie–Bohm theory}}

The [[de Broglie–Bohm theory]] of quantum mechanics (also known as the pilot wave theory) is a theory by [[Louis de Broglie]] and extended later by [[David Bohm]] to include measurements. Particles, which always have positions, are guided by the wavefunction. The wavefunction evolves according to the [[Schrödinger wave equation]], and the wavefunction never collapses. The theory takes place in a single spacetime, is [[Principle of locality|non-local]], and is deterministic. The simultaneous determination of a particle's position and velocity is subject to the usual [[uncertainty principle]] constraint. The theory is considered to be a [[hidden-variable theory]], and by embracing non-locality it satisfies [[Bell's inequality]]. The [[measurement problem]] is resolved, since the particles have definite positions at all times.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Maudlin | first1 = T. | year = 1995 | title = Why Bohm's Theory Solves the Measurement Problem | journal = Philosophy of Science | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 479–483 | doi=10.1086/289879| s2cid = 122114295 }}</ref> Collapse is explained as [[Phenomenology (physics)|phenomenological]].<ref name="CushingFine2013">{{cite arXiv |eprint=quant-ph/9511016 |first1=D. |last1=Durr |first2=N. |last2=Zanghi |title=Bohmian Mechanics as the Foundation of Quantum Mechanics |date=Nov 14, 1995 |last3=Goldstein |first3=S.}} Also published in {{cite book |last1=Cushing |first1=J.

The [[transactional interpretation]] of quantum mechanics (TIQM) by [[John G. Cramer]] is an interpretation of quantum mechanics inspired by the [[Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory]].<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> It describes the collapse of the wave function as resulting from a time-symmetric transaction between a possibility wave from the source to the receiver (the wave function) and a possibility wave from the receiver to source (the complex conjugate of the wave function). This interpretation of quantum mechanics is unique in that it not only views the wave function as a real entity, but the complex conjugate of the wave function, which appears in the Born rule for calculating the expected value for an observable, as also real.

=== Von Neumann–Wigner interpretation ===
{{Main|Von Neumann–Wigner interpretation}}
In his treatise ''The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics'', [[John von Neumann]] deeply analyzed the so-called [[measurement problem]]. He concluded that the entire physical universe could be made subject to the Schrödinger equation (the universal wave function). He also described how measurement could cause a collapse of the wave function.<ref>von Neumann, John. (1932/1955). ''Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics''. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. Translated by Robert T. Beyer.</ref> This point of view was prominently expanded on by [[Eugene Wigner]], who argued that human experimenter consciousness (or maybe even dog consciousness) was critical for the collapse, but he later abandoned this interpretation.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Michael |last=Esfeld |year=1999 |title=Essay Review: Wigner's View of Physical Reality |journal=[[Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics]] |volume=30B |pages=145–154}}</ref><ref name="Schreiber">{{cite arXiv |eprint=quant-ph/9501014 |first=Zvi |last=Schreiber |title=The Nine Lives of Schrödinger's Cat |year=1995}}</ref>

=== Quantum logic ===
{{Main|Quantum logic}}

[[Quantum logic]] can be regarded as a kind of propositional logic suitable for understanding the apparent anomalies regarding quantum measurement, most notably those concerning composition of measurement operations of complementary variables. This research area and its name originated in the 1936 paper by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[John von Neumann]], who attempted to reconcile some of the apparent inconsistencies of classical Boolean logic with the facts related to measurement and observation in quantum mechanics.

=== Modal interpretations of quantum theory ===
Modal interpretations of quantum mechanics were first conceived of in 1972 by [[Bas van Fraassen]], in his paper "A formal approach to the philosophy of science". Van Fraassen introduced a distinction between a ''dynamical'' state, which describes what might be true about a system and which always evolves according to the Schrödinger equation, and a ''value'' state, which indicates what is actually true about a system at a given time. The term "modal interpretation" now is used to describe a larger set of models that grew out of this approach. The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' describes several versions, including proposals by [[Simon B. Kochen|Kochen]], [[Dennis Dieks|Dieks]], Clifton, Dickson, and [[Jeffrey Bub|Bub]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia

 }}</ref> According to [[Michel Bitbol]], Schrödinger's views on how to interpret quantum mechanics progressed through as many as four stages, ending with a non-collapse view that in respects resembles the interpretations of Everett and van Fraassen. Because Schrödinger subscribed to a kind of post-[[Ernst Mach|Machian]] [[neutral monism]], in which "matter" and "mind" are only different aspects or arrangements of the same common elements, treating the wavefunction as ontic and treating it as epistemic became interchangeable.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bitbol|first=Michel|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/851376153|title=Schrödinger's Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics|date=1996|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=978-94-009-1772-9|location=Dordrecht|oclc=851376153}}</ref>

This creates [[retrocausality]]: events in the future can affect ones in the past, exactly as events in the past can affect ones in the future. In these theories, a single measurement cannot fully determine the state of a system (making them a type of [[hidden-variables theory]]), but given two measurements performed at different times, it is possible to calculate the exact state of the system at all intermediate times. The collapse of the wavefunction is therefore not a physical change to the system, just a change in our knowledge of it due to the second measurement. Similarly, they explain entanglement as not being a true physical state but just an illusion created by ignoring retrocausality. The point where two particles appear to "become entangled" is simply a point where each particle is being influenced by events that occur to the other particle in the future.

Not all advocates of time-symmetric causality favour modifying the unitary dynamics of standard quantum mechanics. Thus a leading exponent of the two-state vector formalism, [[Lev Vaidman]], states that the two-state vector formalism dovetails well with [[Hugh Everett]]'s [[many-worlds interpretation]].<ref>Yakir Aharonov, Lev Vaidman: ''The Two-State Vector Formalism of Quantum Mechanics: an Updated Review''.

=== Other interpretations ===
{{Main|Minority interpretations of quantum mechanics}}
As well as the mainstream interpretations discussed above, a number of other interpretations have been proposed which have not made a significant scientific impact for whatever reason. These range from proposals by mainstream physicists to the more [[occult]] ideas of [[quantum mysticism]].

== Related concepts ==
Some ideas are discussed in the context of interpreting quantum mechanics but are not necessarily regarded as interpretations themselves.

=== Quantum Darwinism ===
{{Main|Quantum Darwinism}}
Quantum Darwinism is a theory meant to explain the emergence of the [[Classical physics|classical world]] from the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum world]] as due to a process of [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] [[natural selection]] induced by the environment interacting with the quantum system; where the many possible [[quantum states]] are selected against in favor of a stable [[pointer state]]. It was proposed in 2003 by [[Wojciech Zurek]] and a group of collaborators including Ollivier, Poulin, Paz and Blume-Kohout. The development of the theory is due to the integration of a number of Zurek's research topics pursued over the course of twenty-five years including [[pointer state]]s, [[einselection]] and [[decoherence]].

=== Objective-collapse theories ===
{{Main|Objective-collapse theory}}
Objective-collapse theories differ from the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] by regarding both the wave function and the process of collapse as ontologically objective (meaning these exist and occur independent of the observer). In objective theories, collapse occurs either randomly ("spontaneous localization") or when some physical threshold is reached, with observers having no special role. Thus, objective-collapse theories are realistic, indeterministic, no-hidden-variables theories. Standard quantum mechanics does not specify any mechanism of collapse; quantum mechanics would need to be extended if objective collapse is correct. The requirement for an extension means that objective-collapse theories are alternatives to quantum mechanics rather than interpretations of it. Examples include

== Comparisons ==
The most common interpretations are summarized in the table below. The values shown in the cells of the table are not without controversy, for the precise meanings of some of the concepts involved are unclear and, in fact, are themselves at the center of the controversy surrounding the given interpretation. For another table comparing interpretations of quantum theory, see reference.<ref>{{Cite book|title=What is quantum information?|last1=Olimpia|first1=Lombardi|author1-link=Olimpia Lombardi|author2=Fortin, Sebastian|last3=Federico|first3=Holik|last4=Cristian|first4=López|year=2017|isbn=9781107142114|pages=138–144|oclc=965759965|arxiv = 1509.04711|doi = 10.1017/9781316494233.009|chapter = Interpretations of Quantum Theory: A Map of Madness|s2cid=118419619}}</ref>

No experimental evidence exists that distinguishes among these interpretations. To that extent, the physical theory stands, and is consistent with itself and with reality; difficulties arise only when one attempts to "interpret" the theory. Nevertheless, designing experiments which would test the various interpretations is the subject of active research.

Most of these interpretations have variants. For example, it is difficult to get a precise definition of the Copenhagen interpretation as it was developed and argued by many people.

Perhaps the most interesting responses came from Bohr's old friend, the physicist C. W. Oseen, and from his new ally, the physicist-philosopher Philipp Frank. Oseen had understood at last what he now recognized that Bohr had been saying all along: before a measurement an atom's state with respect to the quantity measured is undefined. Frank saw that Bohr had indeed transfixed EPR on an essential ambiguity. What Frank liked most was the implication that physicists should avoid the term and concept of "physical reality".

Sometimes the Copenhagen (and Bohr’s) interpretation is associated with the epistemic view of the quantum state, according to which the quantum state is but a representation of our knowledge of the physical system, and thus not a real existing entity in itself. On this view the ‘collapse’ of the wave function is not a physical process, and it just reflects an update of our information about the system; see e.g. Zeilinger (1999). By contrast, the Copenhagen interpretation has also been associated with an ontological view of the quantum state, in which the wave function somehow describes a real wave, and the collapse is a real physical process – presumably induced by the observer. This ontological view is usually attributed to von Neumann in his 1932 textbook exposition of quantum mechanics; see e.g. Henderson (2010). [...] Thus, for Bohr, the wave function is a representation of a quantum system in a particular, classically described, experimental context. Three important points need to be made regarding this contextuality: 1) When a measurement is performed (that is, when an irreversible recording has been made; see below), then the context changes, and hence the wave function changes. This can formally be seen as a "collapse" of the wave function, with the square quotes indicating that we are not talking about a physical process in which a real wave collapses.}}</ref>

== The silent approach ==

Although interpretational opinions are openly and widely discussed today, that was not always the case. A notable exponent of a tendency of silence was [[Paul Dirac]] who once wrote: "The interpretation of quantum mechanics has been dealt with by many authors, and I do not want to discuss it here. I want to deal with more fundamental things."<ref>P. A. M. Dirac, The inadequacies of quantum field theory, in Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac, B. N. Kursunoglu and E. P. Wigner, Eds. (Cambridge University, Cambridge, 1987) p. 194</ref> This position is not uncommon among practitioners of quantum mechanics.<ref name="QOE">{{cite book |author=Duarte |first=F. J. |title=Quantum Optics for Engineers |publisher=CRC |year=2014 |isbn=978-1439888537 |location=New York}}</ref> 
Similarly [[Richard Feynman]] wrote many popularizations of quantum mechanics without ever publishing about interpretation issues like quantum measurement.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Zeh |first=H. D. |date=July 2011 |title=Feynman’s interpretation of quantum theory |url=http://link.springer.com/10.1140/epjh/e2011-10035-2 |journal=The European Physical Journal H |language=en |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=63–74 |doi=10.1140/epjh/e2011-10035-2 |issn=2102-6459}}</ref> 
Others, like [[Nico van Kampen]] and [[Willis Lamb]], have openly criticized non-orthodox interpretations of quantum mechanics.<ref>van Kampen, N. G. (2008). "The scandal of quantum mechanics". American Journal of Physics 76: 989.</ref><ref>Lamb, W. E. (2001). "Super classical quantum mechanics: the best interpretation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics". American Journal of Physics. 69: 413–421.</ref>
