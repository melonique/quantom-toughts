{{Short description|Hypothesis that states certain biological neuronal networks work near phase transitions}}
In [[neuroscience]], the '''critical brain hypothesis''' states that certain [[Biological neural network|biological neuronal networks]] work near [[phase transition]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chialvo | first1 = D.

Discussion on the brain's criticality have been done since 1950, with the paper on the imitation game for a Turing test.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Turing | first1 = A.
