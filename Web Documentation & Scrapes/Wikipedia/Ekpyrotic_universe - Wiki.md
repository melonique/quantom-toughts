The '''ekpyrotic universe''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|k|p|aɪ|ˈ|r|ɒ|t|ɪ|k}})<ref>{{Cite news| url = https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=ekpyrotic| title = ekpyrotic | work = American Heritage Dictionary | access-date = October 30, 2016}}</ref> is a [[physical cosmology|cosmological model]] of the early [[universe]] that explains the origin of the large-scale structure of the [[cosmos]]. The model has also been incorporated in the '''cyclic universe''' theory (or '''ekpyrotic cyclic universe''' theory), which proposes a complete cosmological history, both the past and future.

== Origins ==

The original ekpyrotic model was introduced by Justin Khoury, [[Burt Ovrut]], [[Paul Steinhardt]] and [[Neil Turok]] in 2001.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Khoury | first1 = Justin | last2= Ovrut | first2= Burt A.| last3= Steinhardt | first3= Paul J. | last4= Turok |first4= Neil |title = The Ekpyrotic Universe: Colliding Branes and the Origin of the Hot Big Bang| journal = Physical Review D| volume = 64 | issue = 12 | pages = 123522 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.64.123522| arxiv = hep-th/0103239 | year = 2001 | bibcode = 2001PhRvD..64l3522K | s2cid = 374628 }}</ref>

Steinhardt created the name based on the [[Ancient Greek]] word [[ekpyrosis]] (ἐκπύρωσις, "conflagration"), which refers to a [[Stoicism|Stoic]] cosmological model in which the universe is caught in an eternal cycle of fiery birth, cooling and rebirth.<ref>'The dissolution of the universe into fire'. In Stoic philosophy, ''ekpyrosis'', all-engulfing cosmic fire, represents the contractive phase of eternally-recurring destruction and re-creation. On "ekpyrosis" see generally [[Michael Lapidge]], "Stoic Cosmology", in John M. Rist, ''The Stoics,'' Cambridge University Press, 1978, pp. 161–186 [180–184].{{ISBN?}}</ref>

The theory addresses the fundamental question that remains unanswered by the [[Big Bang]] inflationary model, "What happened before the Big Bang?" The explanation, according to the ekpyrotic theory, is that the Big Bang was actually a big bounce, a transition from a previous epoch of contraction to the present epoch of expansion. The key events that shaped our universe occurred before the bounce, and, in a cyclic version, the universe bounces at regular intervals.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Steinhardt | first1 = P.

== Applications of the theory ==

The original ekpyrotic models relied on [[string theory]], [[branes]] and [[extra dimension]]s, but most contemporary ekpyrotic and cyclic models use the same physical ingredients as inflationary models (quantum fields evolving in ordinary space-time).{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Like Big Bang cosmology, the ekpyrotic theory has accurately described essential features of our universe. It predicts a [[Cosmological principle|uniform]], [[Shape of the universe|flat universe]] with patterns of hot spots and cold spots, in agreement with observations of the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB), observations confirmed to higher precision by the [[WMAP]] and [[Planck satellite]] experiments.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Marfatia|first1=Danny|last2=Lee|first2=Hye-Sung|last3=Barger|first3=V.|date=2003-02-18|title=WMAP and Inflation|journal=Physics Letters B|volume=565|pages=33–41|language=en|doi=10.1016/S0370-2693(03)00757-3|arxiv=hep-ph/0302150|bibcode=2003PhLB..565...33B|s2cid=119062633}}</ref> Observation of a CMB has long been considered evidence of the Big Bang,<ref>{{cite arXiv|last=Veneziano|first=G.|date=1998-02-09|title=A Simple/Short Introduction to Pre-Big-Bang Physics/Cosmology|language=en|eprint=hep-th/9802057}}</ref> but proponents of the ekpyrotic and cyclic theories contend that the CMB is also consistent with a Big Bounce as posited in those models.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ovrut|first1=Burt A.|last2=Khoury|first2=Justin|last3=Buchbinder|first3=Evgeny I.|year=2008|title=Non-Gaussianities in New Ekpyrotic Cosmology|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=100|issue=17|page=171302|language=en|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.171302|pmid=18518270|arxiv=0710.5172|bibcode=2008PhRvL.100q1302B|s2cid=2949857}}</ref> Other researchers argue that data from the Planck observations of the CMB "significantly limit the viable parameter space of the ekpyrotic/cyclic scenarios."<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Juvela|first1=M.|last2=Jones|first2=W.

== Implications for cosmology ==
{{Unbalanced section|date=August 2019}}
An advantage of ekpyrotic and cyclic models is that they do not produce a [[multiverse]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} This is important because when the effects of [[quantum fluctuations]] are properly included in the Big Bang inflationary model, they prevent the universe from achieving the uniformity and flatness that the cosmologists are trying to explain.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Instead, inflated quantum fluctuations cause the universe to break up into patches with every conceivable combination of physical properties. Instead of making clear predictions, the Big Bang inflationary theory allows any outcome, so that the properties we observe may be viewed as random chance, resulting from the particular patch of the multiverse in which the Earth resides.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Most regions of the multiverse would have very different properties.

Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg has suggested that if the multiverse is true, “the hope of finding a rational explanation for the precise values of quark masses and other constants of the standard model that we observe in our Big Bang is doomed, for their values would be an accident of the particular part of the multiverse in which we live.”<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/nov/07/physics-what-we-do-and-dont-know/|title= Physics: What we do and don't know |last1= Weinberg |first1= Steven |date= November 20, 2007 |journal= The New York Review of Books }}</ref>

The idea that the properties of our universe are an accident and come from a theory that allows a multiverse of other possibilities is hard to reconcile{{according to whom|date=March 2018}} with the fact that the universe is extraordinarily simple (uniform and flat) on large scales and that elementary [[particles]] appear to be described by simple symmetries and interactions. Also, the accidental concept cannot be falsified by an experiment since any future experiments can be viewed as yet other accidental aspects.

In ekpyrotic and cyclic models, smoothing and flattening occurs during a period of slow contraction, so quantum fluctuations are not inflated and cannot produce a multiverse. As a result, the ekpyrotic and cyclic models predict simple physical properties that are consistent with current experimental evidence without producing a multiverse.
