{{Standard model of particle physics}}

The '''Standard Model''' of [[particle physics]] is the [[theory]] describing three of the four known [[fundamental force]]s ([[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]], [[weak interaction|weak]] and [[strong interaction]]s – excluding [[gravity]]) in the [[universe]] and classifying all known [[elementary particle]]s. It was developed in stages throughout the latter half of the 20th century, through the work of many scientists worldwide,<ref>

It also does not incorporate [[neutrino oscillation]]s and their non-zero masses.

The development of the Standard Model was driven by [[theoretical physics|theoretical]] and [[experimental physics|experimental]] particle physicists alike. The Standard Model is a paradigm of a [[quantum field theory]] for theorists, exhibiting a wide range of phenomena, including [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], [[anomaly (physics)|anomalies]], and non-perturbative behavior. It is used as a basis for building more exotic models that incorporate [[hypothetical particle]]s, [[extra dimensions]], and elaborate symmetries (such as [[supersymmetry]]) to explain experimental results at variance with the Standard Model, such as the existence of dark matter and neutrino oscillations.

== Particle content ==
The Standard Model includes members of several classes of elementary particles, which in turn can be distinguished by other characteristics, such as [[color charge]].

All particles can be summarized as follows:

Each member of a generation has a greater mass than the corresponding particle of generations prior. Thus, there are three generations of quarks and leptons.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |title=Standard Model - ATLAS Physics Cheat Sheet |url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/2759492/files/Standard%20Model%20-%20ATLAS%20Physics%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf |access-date=2024-01-19 |website=[[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]] |publisher=[[CERN]]}}</ref>  As first-generation particles do not decay, they comprise all of ordinary ([[baryon]]ic) matter. Specifically, all atoms consist of electrons orbiting around the [[atomic nucleus]], ultimately constituted of up and down quarks. On the other hand, second- and third-generation charged particles decay with very short [[Half-life|half-lives]] and can only be observed in high-energy environments. Neutrinos of all generations also do not decay, and pervade the universe, but rarely interact with baryonic matter.

There are six quarks: [[up quark|up]], [[down quark|down]], [[charm quark|charm]], [[strange quark|strange]], [[top quark|top]], and [[bottom quark|bottom]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> Quarks carry [[color charge]], and hence interact via the [[strong interaction]]. The [[color confinement]] phenomenon results in quarks being strongly bound together such that they form color-neutral composite particles called [[hadron]]s; quarks cannot individually exist and must always bind with other quarks. Hadrons can contain either a quark-antiquark pair ([[meson]]s) or three quarks ([[baryon]]s).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Color Charge and Confinement |url=https://fafnir.phyast.pitt.edu/particles/color.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020322100232/http://fafnir.phyast.pitt.edu/particles/color.html |archive-date=March 22, 2002 |access-date=January 8, 2024 |website=[[University of Pittsburgh]]}}</ref> The lightest baryons are the [[Nucleon|nucleons]]: the [[proton]] and [[neutron]]. Quarks also carry [[electric charge]] and [[weak isospin]], and thus interact with other fermions through [[electromagnetism]] and [[weak interaction]]. The six leptons consist of the [[electron]], [[electron neutrino]], [[muon]], [[muon neutrino]], [[tau (particle)|tau]], and [[tau neutrino]]. The leptons do not carry color charge, and do not respond to strong interaction. The main leptons carry an [[electric charge]] of -1 ''[[Elementary charge|e]]'', while the three [[neutrino]]s carry a neutral electric charge. Thus, the neutrinos' motion are only influenced by [[weak interaction]] and [[gravity]], making them difficult to observe.

=== Gauge bosons ===

The Standard Model includes 4 kinds of [[gauge boson]]s of [[Spin (physics)|spin]] 1,<ref name=":0" /> with bosons being quantum particles containing an integer spin. The gauge bosons are defined as [[force carrier]]s, as they are responsible for mediating the [[fundamental interaction]]s. The Standard Model explains the four fundamental forces as arising from the interactions, with fermions [[Static forces and virtual-particle exchange|exchanging]] [[Virtual particle|virtual]] force carrier particles, thus mediating the forces. At a macroscopic scale, this manifests as a [[force]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jaeger |first1=Gregg |year=2021 |title=Exchange Forces in Particle Physics |journal=Foundations of Physics |volume=51 |issue=1 |page=13 |bibcode=2021FoPh...51...13J |doi=10.1007/s10701-021-00425-0 |s2cid=231811425}}</ref> As a result, they do not follow the Pauli exclusion principle that constrains fermions; bosons do not have a theoretical limit on their [[volume number density|spatial density]]. The types of gauge bosons are described below.
* [[Electromagnetism]]: [[Photon]]s mediate the electromagnetic force, responsible for interactions between electrically charged particles. The photon is massless and is described by the theory of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED).
* [[Strong interaction|Strong Interactions]]: [[Gluon]]s mediate the strong interactions, which binds quarks to each other by influencing the [[color charge]], with the interactions being described in the theory of [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD). They have no mass, and there are eight distinct gluons, with each being denoted through a color-anticolor charge combination (e.g. red–antigreen).{{NoteTag|Although nine color–anticolor combinations mathematically exist, gluons form color octet particles. As one color-symmetric combination is linear and forms a color singlet particles, there are eight possible gluons.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cahn |first=Robert N. |title=The Experimental Foundations of Particle Physics |last2=Goldbaher |first2=Gerson |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2010 |isbn=978-0521521475 |edition=2nd |publication-date=August 31, 2009 |pages=306 |chapter=Quarks, gluons, and jets |chapter-url=http://hitoshi.berkeley.edu/129A/Cahn-Goldhaber/chapter10.pdf |chapter-format=[[PDF]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714015451/http://hitoshi.berkeley.edu/129A/Cahn-Goldhaber/chapter10.pdf |archive-date=July 14, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>}} As gluons have an effective color charge, they can also interact amongst themselves.
* [[Weak interaction|Weak Interactions]]: The [[W and Z bosons|{{SubatomicParticle|W boson+}}, {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}}, and {{SubatomicParticle|Z boson}}]] gauge bosons mediate the weak interactions between all fermions, being responsible for [[Radioactive decay|radioactivity]]. They contain mass, with the {{SubatomicParticle|Z boson}} having more mass than the {{SubatomicParticle|W boson+-}}. The weak interactions involving the {{SubatomicParticle|W boson+-}} act only on [[Chirality (physics)|''left-handed'' particles and ''right-handed'' antiparticles]]. The {{SubatomicParticle|W boson+-}} carries an electric charge of +1 and −1 and couples to the electromagnetic interaction. The electrically neutral {{SubatomicParticle|Z boson}} boson interacts with both left-handed particles and right-handed antiparticles. These three gauge bosons along with the photons are grouped together, as collectively mediating the [[electroweak]] interaction.
* [[Gravity]]: It is currently unexplained in the Standard Model, as the hypothetical mediating particle [[graviton]] has been proposed, but not observed.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hooper |first=Dan |date=2022-05-19 |title=What is the Standard Model of particle physics, and why are scientists looking beyond it? |url=https://www.astronomy.com/science/what-is-the-standard-model-of-particle-physics-and-why-are-scientists-looking-beyond-it/ |access-date=2024-01-20 |website=[[Astronomy Magazine]] |language=en-US}}</ref> This is due to the incompatibility of quantum mechanics and [[General relativity|Einstein's theory of general relativity]], regarded as being the best explanation for gravity.

The [[Feynman diagram]] calculations, which are a graphical representation of the [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]] approximation, invoke "force mediating particles", and when applied to analyze [[particle accelerator|high-energy scattering experiments]] are in reasonable agreement with the data. However, perturbation theory (and with it the concept of a "force-mediating particle") fails in other situations. These include low-energy quantum chromodynamics, [[bound state]]s, and [[soliton]]s. The interactions between all the particles described by the Standard Model are summarized by the diagrams on the right of this section.

=== Higgs boson ===
{{Main|Higgs boson}}

The Higgs particle is a massive [[Scalar field theory|scalar]] elementary particle theorized by [[Peter Higgs]] ([[1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers|and others]]) in 1964, when he showed that Goldstone's 1962 theorem (generic continuous symmetry, which is spontaneously broken) provides a third polarisation of a massive vector field. Hence, Goldstone's original scalar doublet, the massive spin-zero particle, was [[1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers|proposed as the Higgs boson]], and is a key building block in the Standard Model.<ref>

The Higgs boson plays a unique role in the Standard Model, by explaining why the other elementary particles, except the [[photon]] and [[gluon]], are massive. In particular, the Higgs boson explains why the photon has no mass, while the [[W and Z bosons]] are very heavy. Elementary-particle masses and the differences between [[electromagnetism]] (mediated by the photon) and the [[weak force]] (mediated by the W and Z bosons) are critical to many aspects of the structure of microscopic (and hence macroscopic) matter. In [[electroweak interaction|electroweak theory]], the Higgs boson generates the masses of the leptons (electron, muon, and tau) and quarks.  As the Higgs boson is massive, it must interact with itself.

Because the Higgs boson is a very massive particle and also decays almost immediately when created, only a very high-energy [[particle accelerator]] can observe and record it. Experiments to confirm and determine the nature of the Higgs boson using the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) at [[CERN]] began in early 2010 and were performed at [[Fermilab]]'s [[Tevatron]] until its closure in late 2011. Mathematical consistency of the Standard Model requires that any mechanism capable of generating the masses of elementary particles must become visible{{clarify|reason=Isn't "apparent" or "manifest" needed here instead of "visible"?|date=July 2013}} at energies above {{val|1.4|ul=TeV}};<ref>

Technically, [[quantum field theory]] provides the mathematical framework for the Standard Model, in which a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] controls the dynamics and kinematics of the theory. Each kind of particle is described in terms of a dynamical [[field (physics)|field]] that pervades [[space-time]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Gregg Jaeger | year=2021 | title=The Elementary Particles of Quantum Fields | journal=[[Entropy]] | volume=23 | issue=11 | pages=1416 | doi=10.3390/e23111416 | pmid=34828114 | pmc=8623095 | bibcode=2021Entrp..23.1416J | doi-access=free }}</ref>
The construction of the Standard Model proceeds following the modern method of constructing most field theories: by first postulating a set of symmetries of the system, and then by writing down the most general [[renormalization|renormalizable]] Lagrangian from its particle (field) content that observes these symmetries.

The [[Global symmetry|global]] [[Poincaré group|Poincaré symmetry]] is postulated for all relativistic quantum field theories. It consists of the familiar [[translational symmetry]], [[rotational symmetry]] and the inertial reference frame invariance central to the theory of [[special relativity]]. The [[Local symmetry|local]] SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) [[gauge symmetry]] is an [[Internal symmetries|internal symmetry]] that essentially defines the Standard Model. Roughly, the three factors of the gauge symmetry give rise to the three fundamental interactions. The fields fall into different [[Representation of a Lie group|representations]] of the various symmetry groups of the Standard Model (see table). Upon writing the most general Lagrangian, one finds that the dynamics depends on 19 parameters, whose numerical values are established by experiment. The parameters are summarized in the table (made visible by clicking "show") above.

==== Quantum chromodynamics sector ====
{{Main|Quantum chromodynamics}}
The quantum chromodynamics (QCD) sector defines the interactions between quarks and gluons, which is a [[Yang–Mills theory|Yang–Mills gauge theory]] with SU(3) symmetry, generated by <math>T^a = \lambda^a/2</math>. Since leptons do not interact with gluons, they are not affected by this sector. The Dirac Lagrangian of the quarks coupled to the gluon fields is given by

<math display="block">\mathcal{L}_\text{QCD} = \overline{\psi} i\gamma^\mu D_{\mu} \psi - \frac{1}{4} G^a_{\mu\nu} G^{\mu\nu}_a,</math>

where <math>\psi</math> is a three component column vector of [[Dirac Spinor|Dirac Spinors]], each element of which refers to a quark field with a specific [[color charge]] (i.e. red, blue, and green) and summation over [[Flavour (particle physics)|flavor]] (i.e. up, down, strange, etc.) is implied. 

The gauge covariant derivative of QCD is defined by <math>D_{\mu} \equiv \partial_\mu - i g_s\frac{1}{2}\lambda^a G_\mu^a</math>, where
* {{mvar|γ{{isup|μ}}}} are the [[Dirac matrices]],
* {{mvar|G{{su|b=μ|p=a}}}} is the 8-component (<math>a = 1, 2, \dots, 8</math>) SU(3) gauge field,
* {{mvar|λ{{su|p=a}}}} are the 3 × 3 [[Gell-Mann matrices]], generators of the SU(3) color group,
* {{mvar|G{{su|b=μν|p=a}}}} represents the [[gluon field strength tensor]], and
* {{mvar|g<sub>s</sub>}} is the strong coupling constant.

The QCD Lagrangian is invariant under local SU(3) gauge transformations; i.e., transformations of the form <math>\psi \rightarrow \psi' = U\psi</math>, where <math>U = e^{-i g_s\lambda^a \phi^{a}(x)}</math> is <math>3\times 3</math> unitary matrix with determinant 1, making it a member of the group SU(3), and <math>\phi^{a}(x)</math> is an arbitrary function of spacetime.

==== Electroweak sector ====
{{Main|Electroweak interaction}}
The electroweak sector is a [[Yang–Mills theory|Yang–Mills gauge theory]] with the symmetry group U(1) × SU(2)<sub>L</sub>,

<math display="block">\mathcal{L}_\text{EW} = \overline{Q}_{Lj} i\gamma^\mu D_{\mu} Q_{Lj} + \overline{u}_{Rj} i\gamma^\mu D_{\mu} u_{Rj} + \overline{d}_{Rj} i\gamma^\mu D_{\mu} d_{Rj} + \overline{\ell}_{Lj} i\gamma^\mu D_{\mu} \ell_{Lj} + \overline{e}_{Rj} i\gamma^\mu D_{\mu} e_{Rj} - \tfrac{1}{4} W_a^{\mu\nu} W_{\mu\nu}^a - \tfrac{1}{4} B^{\mu\nu} B_{\mu\nu}, </math>

where the subscript <math>j</math> sums over the three generations of fermions; <math>Q_L, u_R</math>, and <math>d_R</math> are the left-handed doublet, right-handed singlet up type, and right handed singlet down type quark fields; and <math>\ell_L</math> and <math>e_R</math> are the left-handed doublet and right-handed singlet lepton fields. 

The electroweak [[gauge covariant derivative]] is defined as <math>D_\mu \equiv \partial_\mu - ig' \tfrac12 Y_\text{W} B_\mu - ig \tfrac{1}{2} \vec\tau_\text{L} \vec W_\mu</math>, where 
* {{mvar|B<sub>μ</sub>}} is the U(1) gauge field,
* {{math|''Y''<sub>W</sub>}} is the [[weak hypercharge]] – the generator of the U(1) group,
* {{math|{{vec|''W''}}<sub>''μ''</sub>}} is the 3-component SU(2) gauge field,
* {{math|{{vec|''τ''<sub>L</sub>}}}} are the [[Pauli matrices]] – infinitesimal generators of the SU(2) group – with subscript L to indicate that they only act on ''left''-chiral fermions,
* {{mvar|g'}} and {{mvar|g}} are the U(1) and SU(2) coupling constants respectively,
* <math>W^{a\mu\nu}</math> (<math>a = 1, 2, 3</math>) and <math>B^{\mu\nu}</math> are the [[field strength tensor]]s for the weak isospin and weak hypercharge fields.

Notice that the addition of fermion mass terms into the electroweak Lagrangian is forbidden, since terms of the form <math>m\overline\psi\psi</math> do not respect U(1) × SU(2)<sub>L</sub> gauge invariance. Neither is it possible to add explicit mass terms for the U(1) and SU(2) gauge fields. The Higgs mechanism is responsible for the generation of the gauge boson masses, and the fermion masses result from Yukawa-type interactions with the Higgs field.

==== Higgs sector ====
{{Main|Higgs mechanism}}
In the Standard Model, the [[Higgs field]] is an <math>\operatorname{SU}(2)_\text{L}</math> doublet of complex [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] fields with four degrees of freedom:

<math display="block"> 
\varphi = \begin{pmatrix} \varphi^+ \\ \varphi^0 \end{pmatrix}
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} \varphi_1 + i\varphi_2 \\ \varphi_3 + i\varphi_4 \end{pmatrix},
</math>
where the superscripts + and 0 indicate the electric charge <math>Q</math> of the components. The weak hypercharge <math>Y_\text{W}</math> of both components is 1. Before symmetry breaking, the Higgs Lagrangian is
<math display="block"> \mathcal{L}_\text{H} = \left(D_{\mu}\varphi\right)^{\dagger} \left(D^{\mu}\varphi \right) - V(\varphi),</math>
where <math>D_{\mu}</math> is the electroweak gauge covariant derivative defined above and <math>V(\varphi)</math> is the potential of the Higgs field. The square of the covariant derivative leads to three and four point interactions between the electroweak gauge fields <math>W^{a}_{\mu}</math> and <math>B_{\mu}</math> and the scalar field <math>\varphi</math>. The scalar potential is given by
<math display="block"> V(\varphi) = -\mu^2\varphi^{\dagger}\varphi + \lambda \left( \varphi^{\dagger}\varphi \right)^2, </math>
where <math>\mu^2>0</math>, so that <math>\varphi</math> acquires a non-zero [[Vacuum expectation value]], which generates masses for the Electroweak gauge fields (the Higgs' mechanism), and <math>\lambda>0</math>, so that the potential is bounded from below. The quartic term describes self-interactions of the scalar field <math>\varphi</math>.

The minimum of the potential is degenerate with an infinite number of equivalent [[ground state]] solutions, which occurs when <math>\varphi^{\dagger}\varphi = \tfrac{\mu^2}{2\lambda}</math>. It is possible to perform a [[Unitary gauge|gauge transformation]] on <math>\varphi</math> such that the ground state is transformed to a basis where <math>\varphi_1 = \varphi_2 = \varphi_4 = 0</math> and <math>\varphi_3 = \tfrac{\mu}{\sqrt{\lambda}} \equiv v </math>. This breaks the symmetry of the ground state. The expectation value of <math>\varphi</math> now becomes 
<math display="block"> \langle \varphi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ v \end{pmatrix},</math>
where <math>v</math> has units of mass and sets the scale of electroweak physics. This is the only dimensional parameter of the Standard Model and has a measured value of ~{{val|246|u=GeV/c2}}. 

After symmetry breaking, the masses of the <math>\text{W}</math> and <math>\text{Z}</math> are given by <math>m_\text{W}=\frac{1}{2}gv</math> and <math> m_\text{Z}=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{g^2+g'^2}v</math>, which can be viewed as predictions of the theory. The photon remains massless. The mass of the [[Higgs Boson]] is <math>m_\text{H}=\sqrt{2\mu^2}=\sqrt{2\lambda}v</math>. Since <math>\mu</math> and <math>\lambda</math> are free parameters, the Higgs' mass could not be predicted beforehand and had to be determined experimentally.

==== Yukawa sector ====
The [[Yukawa interaction]] terms are:

<math display="block">\mathcal{L}_\text{Yukawa} = (Y_\text{u})_{mn}(\bar{Q}_\text{L})_m \tilde{\varphi}(u_\text{R})_n + (Y_\text{d})_{mn}(\bar{Q}_\text{L})_m \varphi(d_\text{R})_n + (Y_\text{e})_{mn}(\bar{\ell}_\text{L})_m {\varphi}(e_\text{R})_n + \mathrm{h.c.} </math>

where <math>Y_\text{u}</math>, <math>Y_\text{d}</math>, and <math>Y_\text{e}</math> are {{math|3 × 3}} matrices of Yukawa couplings, with the {{mvar|mn}} term giving the coupling of the generations {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}}, and h.c. means Hermitian conjugate of preceding terms. The fields <math>Q_\text{L}</math> and <math>\ell_\text{L}</math> are left-handed quark and lepton doublets. Likewise, <math>u_\text{R}, d_\text{R}</math> and <math>e_\text{R}</math> are right-handed up-type quark, down-type quark, and lepton singlets. Finally <math>\varphi</math> is the Higgs doublet and <math>\tilde{\varphi} = i\tau_2\varphi^{*}</math> is its charge conjugate state.

The Yukawa terms are invariant under the <math>\operatorname{SU}(2)_\text{L} \times \operatorname{U}(1)_\text{Y}</math> gauge symmetry of the Standard Model and generate masses for all fermions after spontaneous symmetry breaking.

== Fundamental interactions ==
{{Main|Fundamental interaction}}
The Standard Model describes three of the four fundamental interactions in nature; only gravity remains unexplained. In the Standard Model, such an interaction is described as an exchange of [[boson]]s between the objects affected, such as a [[photon]] for the electromagnetic force and a [[gluon]] for the strong interaction. Those particles are called [[force carrier]]s or messenger [[particles]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cern/science/physics/standard-model|title=The Standard Model|website=CERN|date=15 December 2023 }}</ref>

=== Gravity ===
{{See also|Quantum gravity|Gravity}}
Despite being perhaps the most familiar fundamental interaction, gravity is not described by the Standard Model, due to contradictions that arise when combining general relativity, the modern theory of gravity, and quantum mechanics. However, gravity is so weak at microscopic scales, that it is essentially unmeasurable. The graviton is postulated as the mediating particle but has not yet been proved to exist.

=== Electromagnetism ===
{{See also|Electromagnetism|Quantum electrodynamics}}
Electromagnetism is the only long-range force in the Standard Model. It is mediated by photons and couples to electric charge.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-12-04 |title=The Standard Model |url=https://home.cern/science/physics/standard-model |access-date=2023-12-17 |website=CERN |language=en}}</ref> Electromagnetism is responsible for a wide range of phenomena including [[Electron shell|atomic electron shell structure]], [[chemical bonds]], [[electric circuit]]s and [[electronics]]. Electromagnetic interactions in the Standard Model are described by quantum electrodynamics.

=== Weak nuclear force ===
{{See also|Weak interaction|Electroweak interaction}}
The weak interaction is responsible for various forms of [[particle decay]], such as [[beta decay]]. It is weak and short-range, due to the fact that the weak mediating particles, W and Z bosons, have mass. W bosons have electric charge and mediate interactions that change the particle type (referred to as flavour) and charge. Interactions mediated by W bosons are [[charged current interaction]]s. Z bosons are neutral and mediate neutral current interactions, which do not change particle flavour. Thus Z bosons are similar to the photon, aside from them being massive and interacting with the neutrino. The weak interaction is also the only interaction to violate [[Parity violation|parity]] and [[CP violation|CP]]. Parity violation is maximal for charged current interactions, since the W boson interacts exclusively with left-handed fermions and right-handed antifermions.

In the Standard Model, the weak force is understood in terms of the electroweak theory, which states that the weak and electromagnetic interactions become united into a single ''electroweak'' interaction at high energies.

=== Strong nuclear force ===
{{See also|Strong interaction|Nuclear force|Quantum chromodynamics}}
The strong nuclear force is responsible for hadronic and [[Nuclear binding energy|nuclear binding]]. It is mediated by gluons, which couple to color charge. Since gluons themselves have color charge, the strong force exhibits [[Color confinement|confinement]] and [[asymptotic freedom]]. Confinement means that only color-neutral particles can exist in isolation, therefore quarks can only exist in hadrons and never in isolation, at low energies. Asymptotic freedom means that the strong force becomes weaker, as the energy scale increases. The strong force overpowers the [[electrostatic]] repulsion of protons and quarks in nuclei and hadrons respectively, at their respective scales.

While quarks are bound in hadrons by the fundamental strong interaction, which is mediated by gluons, nucleons are bound by an emergent phenomenon termed the ''residual strong force'' or ''[[nuclear force]]''. This interaction is mediated by mesons, such as the [[pion]]. The color charges inside the nucleon cancel out, meaning most of the gluon and quark fields cancel out outside of the nucleon. However, some residue is "leaked", which appears as the exchange of virtual mesons, that causes the attractive force between nucleons. The (fundamental) strong interaction is described by quantum chromodynamics, which is a component of the Standard Model.

== Tests and predictions ==
The Standard Model predicted the existence of the [[W and Z bosons]], [[gluon]], [[top quark]] and [[charm quark]], and predicted many of their properties before these particles were observed. The predictions were experimentally confirmed with good precision.<ref>
{{cite journal |last1=Woithe |first1=Julia |last2=Wiener |first2=Gerfried |last3=Van der Veken |first3=Frederik |title=Let's have a coffee with the Standard Model of particle physics! |journal=Phys.

The Standard Model also predicted the existence of the [[Higgs boson]], which was found in 2012 at the [[Large Hadron Collider]], the final fundamental particle predicted by the Standard Model to be experimentally confirmed.<ref>

Self-consistency of the Standard Model (currently formulated as a non-[[abelian group|abelian]] gauge theory quantized through path-integrals) has not been mathematically proven.  While regularized versions useful for approximate computations (for example [[lattice gauge theory]]) exist, it is not known whether they converge (in the sense of S-matrix elements) in the limit that the regulator is removed.  A key question related to the consistency is the [[Yang–Mills existence and mass gap]] problem.

Experiments indicate that [[neutrinos]] have [[mass]], which the classic Standard Model did not allow.<ref>

}}</ref> As long as new physics appears below or around 10<sup>14</sup> [[electronvolt|GeV]], the neutrino masses can be of the right order of magnitude.

Theoretical and experimental research has attempted to extend the Standard Model into a [[unified field theory]] or a [[theory of everything]], a complete theory explaining all physical phenomena including constants. Inadequacies of the Standard Model that motivate such research include:
* The model does not explain [[gravitation]], although physical confirmation of a theoretical particle known as a [[graviton]] would account for it to a degree. Though it addresses strong and electroweak interactions, the Standard Model does not consistently explain the canonical theory of gravitation, [[general relativity]], in terms of [[quantum field theory]]. The reason for this is, among other things, that quantum field theories of gravity generally break down before reaching the [[Planck scale]]. As a consequence, we have no reliable theory for the very early universe.
* Some physicists consider it to be ''ad hoc'' and inelegant, requiring 19 numerical constants whose values are unrelated and arbitrary.<ref name="BlumhoferHutter1997">

* The Higgs mechanism gives rise to the [[hierarchy problem]] if some new physics (coupled to the Higgs) is present at high energy scales. In these cases, in order for the weak scale to be much smaller than the [[Planck scale]], severe fine tuning of the parameters is required; there are, however, other scenarios that include [[Asymptotic safety in quantum gravity|quantum gravity]] in which such fine tuning can be avoided.<ref>

* The model is inconsistent with the emerging [[Lambda-CDM model]] of cosmology. Contentions include the absence of an explanation in the Standard Model of particle physics for the observed amount of [[cold dark matter]] (CDM) and its contributions to [[dark energy]], which are many orders of magnitude too large. It is also difficult to accommodate the observed predominance of matter over antimatter ([[matter]]/[[antimatter]] [[Baryon asymmetry|asymmetry]]). The [[isotropic|isotropy]] and [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]] of the visible universe over large distances seems to require a mechanism like cosmic [[Inflation (cosmology)|inflation]], which would also constitute an extension of the Standard Model.

Currently, no proposed [[theory of everything]] has been widely accepted or verified.
