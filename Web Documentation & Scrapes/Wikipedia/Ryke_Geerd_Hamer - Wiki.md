Hamer held a licence to practice medicine from 1963 until 1986, when it was revoked for [[Medical malpractice|malpractice]]. His system came to public attention in 1995, when the parents of a child suffering from cancer refused medical treatment (chemical therapy or chemotherapy) in favour of Hamer's methods. Hamer was charged with malpractice and imprisoned in several European countries.

Hamer claimed that his method was a "Germanic" alternative to mainstream clinical medicine, which he claimed is part of a [[List of conspiracy theories#Antisemitic conspiracy theories|Jewish conspiracy]] to decimate non-Jews.

==Biography==
Ryke Geerd Hamer was born in [[Mettmann]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], in 1935. He received his [[high school diploma]] at age 18 and started medical and [[theology|theological studies]] in [[Tübinger Stift|Tübingen]], where he met Sigrid Oldenburg, a medical student who later became his wife. At age 20, Hamer passed the preliminary examination in medicine, and in April 1962 passed his medical state examination in [[Marburg]], [[Hesse]]. He was granted a professional license as a doctor of medicine in 1963. After spending several years at the University Clinics of Tübingen and [[Heidelberg]], Hamer completed his specialization in internal medicine in 1972. He also worked in several practices with his wife and [[patent]]ed several inventions.<ref name=GNM>{{cite web |author=Caroline Markolin |title=German/Germanic New Medicine, Dr. Hamer's website |url=http://www.germannewmedicine.ca |language=en, fr, es}}</ref>

Hamer's license to practice medicine was revoked in 1986 by a court judgment, which was reconfirmed in 2003. As he continued to practice, Hamer was investigated several times over allegations of [[malpractice]] and causing the deaths of patients.<ref>case file number 34 Js 85/86 – 34 Js 178/95 – 34 Js 221/96 Public Prosecution Service Cologne</ref> He was jailed for twelve months in Germany from 1997 to 1998, and served a prison term from September 2004 to February 2006 in [[Fleury-Mérogis]], France, on counts of [[fraud]] and unlicensed practice of medicine.

Hamer's [[habilitation]] thesis about the GNM at the University of Tübingen was rejected after multiple examinations by several members of the medical faculty, who concluded that his work lacked scientific methods and reproducibility and his arguments did not support his theories.<ref>{{cite web|date=21 June 2004|title=ruling of a german court about this matter documented on Pilhars page|url=http://pilhar.com/Hamer/Korrespo/1986/861217.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209110610/http://pilhar.com/Hamer/Korrespo/1986/861217.htm|archive-date=9 February 2006|access-date=20 November 2011}}</ref> Hamer claimed that his system was verifiable and that the [[University of Trnava]] in Slovakia had already confirmed some of his theories.<ref name="GNM" /> In fact, the University of Trnava has no real medical faculty and the documents which allegedly confirmed his view are not available and registered at the university.<ref>Correspondence on Pilhars Page: https://web.archive.org/web/20060216141824/http://www.pilhar.com/Hamer/Korrespo/1999/990114.htm</ref><ref>The university has a faculty specialized only in social work and healthcare/nursing http://www.truni.sk/fakulty</ref> That university also rejected his habilitation thesis.<ref>Correspondence on Pilhars page: https://web.archive.org/web/20060216141839/http://www.pilhar.com/Hamer/Korrespo/1999/990208.htm</ref>

==Germanic New Medicine==
On 8 August 1978, Hamer's son, Dirk, was shot by the son of the last king of Italy, [[Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples|Vittorio Emanuele of Savoy]], while asleep on a yacht off [[Cavallo (island)|Cavallo]] and died on 7 December of that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.germannewmedicine.ca/documents/hamerbio.html |title=A Short Biography |access-date=7 May 2011}}</ref> Sometime after Dirk's death, Hamer developed testicular cancer and thought there was a link between the two events, so he began to develop Germanic New Medicine (GNM), which can be summarized in its "five biological laws":<ref name=GNM />
* 1st law ("Iron Rule"): Severe diseases originate from a [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] event which is experienced by the individual as very difficult, highly acute, dramatic, and isolating. The shock’s psychological conflict content determines the location of the appearance of a focus of activity in the brain that can be seen in a [[CT scan]] as a set of concentric rings, called "Hamer foci", which correspond to the location of the disease in the body. The subsequent development of the conflict determines the development of both the brain focus and the disease.
* 2nd law (Two phased nature of disease): A patient who has not solved their conflict is in the first, active conflict phase, where the [[sympathetic nervous system]] predominates and which manifests as a "cold disease" accompanied by cold skin and extremities, [[Stress (biology)|stress]], weight loss and [[sleep disorder]]s. If they manage to resolve the conflict, they enter a second, post-resolution healing phase, in which the [[parasympathetic nervous system]] predominates, commonly diagnosed as a separate "warm" ([[Rheumatology|rheumatic]], [[Infection|infectious]], [[Allergy|allergic]], etc.) disease. This second phase is the one that usually entails more risks, and a complete cure only comes upon its completion. In some circumstances, not solving the conflict but downgrading it to a reasonably livable level may be preferable to facing the second phase.
* 3rd law (Ontogenetic system of diseases): Hamer proposes that disease progression is primarily controlled by the brain, either by the "old brain" ([[brainstem]] and [[cerebellum]]) or the "new brain" ([[cerebrum]]). The old brain controls more primitive processes, having to do with basic survival, such as breathing, eating, and reproduction, whereas the new brain manages more advanced personal and social issues, such as territorial conflicts, separation conflicts, and self-devaluation and identity conflicts. Hamer's research is tied to the science of embryology because he links the type of disease progression—whether involving tissue augmentation (tumor growth), tissue loss (necrosis or ulceration), or functional impairment—with the embryonic germ layer ([[endoderm]], [[mesoderm]] or [[ectoderm]]) from which both the organ tissues and the corresponding brain regions originate. Conflicts which have their focus either in the brain stem (which controls body tissues that derive from the endoderm) or the cerebellum (which controls tissues that derive from the mesoderm) show cell multiplication in the conflict active phase, and destruction of the resulting tumors in the healing phase. Cerebrum directed conflicts (affecting the rest of mesoderm-derived tissues and all ectoderm-derived ones) show either cell decrease (necroses, ulcers) or function impairment or interruption in the active phase, and the replenishment of the damaged tissues in the healing phase (which can also be diagnosed as a tumor).
* 4th law (Ontogenetic system of [[Microorganism|microbes]]): Microbes do not cause diseases but are used by the body, coordinated by the brain, to optimize the healing phase, provided that the required microbes are available when needed. Fungi and [[Mycobacterium|mycobacteria]] work on tissues that originated in the endoderm, as well as on some of the tissues originating in the mesoderm. Bacteria work on all mesoderm-derived tissues and viruses on ectoderm-derived ones. Hamer maintains that these microbes, rather than being antagonistic to the body, actually perform a necessary role in healing, and that some of the interventions of conventional medicine are counterproductive, by interfering with these natural processes.
* 5th law ("Quintessence"): The conflict active phase and the healing phase of diseases, as described above, constitute "special meaningful programs of nature," developed during the [[evolution]] of the species, to allow [[organism]]s to override everyday functioning in order to deal with particular emergency situations.

Therefore, according to Hamer, no real diseases exist; rather, what established medicine calls a "disease" is actually a "special meaningful program of nature" (''sinnvolles biologisches Sonderprogramm'') to which bacteria, viruses and [[fungi]] belong. Hamer's GNM claims to explain every disease and treatment according to those premises, and to thereby obviate traditional medicine. The cure is always the resolving of the conflict. Some treatments like [[chemotherapy]] or pain relieving drugs like [[morphine]] are deadly according to Hamer.<ref name=hamer1>{{cite web |url=http://dr-rykegeerdhamer.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=362&Itemid=76 |title=Dr.med.Mag.theol.

==Olivia Pilhar case==
In 1995, Hamer was associated with the case of Olivia Pilhar, a six-year-old Austrian girl who suffered from a [[Wilms' tumor]]. Pilhar's parents were members of [[Fiat Lux (UFO religion)|Fiat Lux]], a [[new religious movement]] whose leader [[Uriella]] referred them to Hamer. He diagnosed the girl as having several "conflicts" rather than cancer. When the parents refused conventional medical therapy for Pilhar, the [[Government of Austria|Austrian government]] removed their rights of care and control. The parents fled with their daughter to Spain, which was Hamer's place of residence at the time.

After negotiations, including the intervention of the [[President of Austria|Austrian President]] [[Thomas Klestil]], the parents were persuaded to return to Austria. By then, Pilhar's health had deteriorated. The tumor had grown very large, weighing four kilograms, filling most of her abdominal cavity and was pressing against her lungs. The lack of treatment had reduced the estimate of survival probability from 90% to 10%.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/parents-on-trial-for-cancer-treatment-refusal-1357672.html |location=London |work=The Independent  | title=Parents on trial for cancer treatment refusal | date=10 October 1996}}</ref> After a court ordered conventional cancer treatment with surgery, [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiation therapy]], Pilhar recovered completely and was still alive in 2010.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bild.de/news/vermischtes/geschichte/so-schoen-ist-sie-heute-5137142.bild.html |title=So schön ist Krebs-Kind Olivia heute |publisher=Bild |first=Antje |last=Windmann |date=17 February 2010 |access-date=15 May 2011 |language=de |trans-title=So beautiful is Cancer Child Olivia today}}</ref> Her parents received an eight-month suspended jail sentence in Austria.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://diepresse.com/home/panorama/oesterreich/533340/Opfer-und-Medienstar_Der-Fall-Olivia-Pilhar |title=Opfer und Medienstar: Der Fall Olivia Pilhar |publisher=Die Presse |date=16 January 2010 |access-date=15 May 2011 |language=de |trans-title=Victims and the Media Star: The case of Olivia Pilhar}}</ref>

==Jewish conspiracy theory==
Hamer purported that his method is a "Germanic" alternative to mainstream clinical medicine, which he claimed is part of a [[List of conspiracy theories#Antisemitic conspiracy theories|Jewish conspiracy]] to decimate non-Jews.<ref> An example among many: [https://web.archive.org/web/20160506162646/http://drrykegeerdhamer.com/de/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=327&Itemid=61 Germanische Heilkunde: Interview, 4 November 2009] (Internet Archive, 6 May 2016). See: Alma Fatmi, 'Die ideologischen Hintergründe der Germanischen Neuen Medizin', in: Udo Schuster (ed.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/37139383/Rassismus_im_neuen_Gewand_-_Herausforderungen_im_Kommunikationszeitalter_4.0_Udo_Schuster_Hrsg_ Rassismus im neuen Gewand. Herausforderungen im Kommunikationszeitalter 4.0]'', München 2017, p. 81–112.</ref> In this, Hamer repeated the [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] claims of [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] physician [[Gerhard Wagner (physician)|Gerhard Wagner]]. More precisely, Hamer asserted that chemotherapy and morphine are used to "mass murder" Western civilization, while such treatment is not used in [[Israel]].<ref name=hamer1 /><ref name=hamer2 /><ref name=TAZ /> Hamer promoted the idea that most German [[Oncology|oncologists]] are Jewish and that "no Jew is treated with chemotherapy in Germany." According to him, hypodermic needles are used during chemotherapy to implant "chips" containing "chambers of poison" that can be activated by satellite to specifically kill patients.<ref>Report München: ''Todesfalle Germanische Neue Medizin''. ARD, 18. Januar 2010</ref> He proposed that the [[2009 flu pandemic vaccine|swine flu vaccination campaign]] of 2009 was also used to mark people with those "chips" and [[HIV/AIDS denialism|denied the existence of HIV]].<ref>[http://derstandard.at/1262209517741/Wunderheiler-Ryke-Geerd-Hamer-HIV-ist-eine-ganz-normale-Allergie ''Ryke Geerd Hamer: "HIV ist eine ganz normale Allergie"''] Der Standard, 14. Januar 2012</ref> Hamer also believed that the denial of recognition of his theories and the revocation of his practitioner's licence is due to a Jewish conspiracy.<ref name=TAZ>[http://www.taz.de/1/archiv/archiv/?dig=2006/01/30/a0080 Germanisch gegen Krebs], TAZ 30 January 2006</ref>

In 2008, Hamer presented a document where one "[[Chief Rabbi]]" "Esra" Iwan Götz confirmed the existence of a conspiracy among Jewish oncologists to use the "torture" of chemotherapy on all non-Jewish patients, while Jewish patients were to receive the "correct" treatment of GNM. Götz, a German [[Holocaust denialism|holocaust denier]] active in the [[Reichsbürgerbewegung|German Reich revivalism]] scene, has been repeatedly convicted by German courts<ref>He received a suspended eight-month sentence for [[Volksverhetzung]] from an [[Anklam]] court in 2009.
