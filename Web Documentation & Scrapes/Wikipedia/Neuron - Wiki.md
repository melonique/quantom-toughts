Within a [[nervous system]], a '''neuron''', '''neurone''', or '''nerve cell''' is an [[membrane potential#Cell excitability|electrically excitable]] [[cell (biology)|cell]] that fires electric signals called [[action potentials]] across a [[neural network (biology)|neural network]]. Neurons communicate with other cells via [[synapse]]s, which are specialized connections that commonly use minute amounts of chemical [[neurotransmitter]]s to pass the electric signal from the presynaptic neuron to the target cell through the synaptic gap. 

Neurons are the main components of [[nervous tissue]] in all [[Animalia|animals]] except [[sponge]]s and [[Placozoa]]. Non-animals like [[plant]]s and [[fungi]] do not have nerve cells. Molecular evidence suggests that the ability to generate electric signals first appeared in evolution some 700 to 800 million years ago, during the [[Tonian]] period. Predecessors of neurons were the [[peptidergic|peptidergic]] secretory cells. They eventually gained new gene modules which enabled cells to create post-synaptic scaffolds and ion channels that generate fast electrical signals. The ability to generate electric signals was a key innovation in the evolution of the nervous system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(23)00917-0|title=Stepwise emergence of the neuronal gene expression program in early animal evolution: Cell}}</ref>

Neurons are typically classified into three types based on their function. [[Sensory neuron]]s respond to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] such as touch, sound, or light that affect the cells of the [[Sense|sensory organs]], and they send signals to the [[spinal cord]] or [[brain]]. [[Motor neuron]]s receive signals from the brain and spinal cord to control everything from [[muscle contraction]]s<ref>Zayia LC, Tadi P. Neuroanatomy, Motor Neuron. [Updated 2022 Jul 25]. In: StatPearls [Internet]. Treasure Island (FL): StatPearls Publishing; 2023 Jan-. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554616/ </ref> to [[gland|glandular output]]. [[Interneuron]]s connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord. When multiple neurons are functionally connected together, they form what is called a [[neural circuit]].

Neurons are special cells which are made up of some structures that are common to all other eukaryotic cells such as the cell body (soma), a nucleus, smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, [[mitochondria]], and other cellular components.<ref name=":0" /> Additionally, neurons have other unique structures  such as [[dendrite]]s, and a single [[axon]].<ref name=":0">Zedalis J. and Eggebrecht J. (2018, Mar 8)  Biology for AP® Courses 26.1 Neurons and Glial Cells. OpenStax https://openstax.org/books/biology-ap-courses/pages/26-1-neurons-and-glial-cells  (Accessed 2023, Aug 15).
</ref> The soma is a compact structure, and the axon and dendrites are filaments extruding from the soma. Dendrites typically branch profusely and extend a few hundred micrometers from the soma. The axon leaves the soma at a swelling called the [[axon hillock]] and travels for as far as 1 meter in humans or more in other species. It branches but usually maintains a constant diameter. At the farthest tip of the axon's branches are [[axon terminals]], where the neuron can transmit a signal across the [[synapse]] to another cell. Neurons may lack dendrites or have no axon. The term [[neurite]] is used to describe either a dendrite or an axon, particularly when the cell is [[Cellular differentiation|undifferentiated]].

Most neurons receive signals via the dendrites and soma and send out signals down the axon. At the majority of synapses, signals cross from the axon of one neuron to a dendrite of another. However, synapses can connect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite.

The signaling process is partly electrical and partly chemical. Neurons are electrically excitable, due to maintenance of [[voltage]] gradients across their [[Cell membrane|membranes]]. If the voltage changes by a large enough amount over a short interval, the neuron generates an [[All-or-none law|all-or-nothing]] [[electrochemical]] pulse called an [[action potential]]. This potential travels rapidly along the axon and activates synaptic connections as it reaches them. Synaptic signals may be [[Excitatory postsynaptic potential|excitatory]] or [[Inhibitory postsynaptic potential|inhibitory]], increasing or reducing the net voltage that reaches the soma.

In most cases, neurons are generated by [[neural stem cell]]s during brain development and childhood. [[Neurogenesis]] largely ceases during adulthood in most areas of the brain.

Axons may bundle into [[nerve fascicle|fascicle]]s that make up the [[nerve]]s in the peripheral nervous system (like strands of wire make up cables). Bundles of axons in the central nervous system are called [[nerve tract|tracts]].

== Anatomy and histology ==
[[File:Blausen 0657 MultipolarNeuron.png|thumb|Diagram of the components of a neuron]]
Neurons are highly specialized for the processing and transmission of cellular signals. Given their diversity of functions performed in different parts of the nervous system, there is a wide variety in their shape, size, and electrochemical properties. For instance, the soma of a neuron can vary from 4 to 100 [[Micrometre|micrometers]] in diameter.<ref>{{cite web |first = Melissa |last = Davies |title = The Neuron: size comparison |url = https://www.ualberta.ca/~neuro/OnlineIntro/NeuronExample.htm |work = Neuroscience: A journey through the brain |date = 2002-04-09 |access-date = 2009-06-20}}</ref>
* The '''[[Soma (biology)|soma]]''' is the body of the neuron. As it contains the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], most [[protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]] occurs here. The nucleus can range from 3 to 18 micrometers in diameter.<ref>{{cite web |first = Eric H. |last = Chudler | name-list-style = vanc |title = Brain Facts and Figures |url = http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/facts.html |work = Neuroscience for Kids |access-date = 2009-06-20 }}</ref>
* The '''[[dendrites]]''' of a neuron are cellular extensions with many branches. This overall shape and structure are referred to metaphorically as a dendritic tree. This is where the majority of input to the neuron occurs via the [[dendritic spine]].
* The '''[[axon]]''' is a finer, cable-like projection that can extend tens, hundreds, or even tens of thousands of times the diameter of the soma in length. The axon primarily carries [[nerve signal]]s away from the soma and carries some types of information back to it. Many neurons have only one axon, but this axon may—and usually will—undergo extensive branching, enabling communication with many target cells. The part of the axon where it emerges from the soma is called the '''[[axon hillock]]'''. Besides being an anatomical structure, the axon hillock also has the greatest density of [[voltage-dependent sodium channels]]. This makes it the most easily excited part of the neuron and the spike initiation zone for the axon. In electrophysiological terms, it has the most negative [[threshold potential]].
** While the axon and axon hillock are generally involved in information outflow, this region can also receive input from other neurons.
* The '''[[axon terminal]]''' is found at the end of the axon farthest from the soma and contains [[synapses]]. Synaptic boutons are specialized structures where [[neurotransmitter]] chemicals are released to communicate with target neurons. In addition to synaptic boutons at the axon terminal, a neuron may have ''en passant'' boutons, which are located along the length of the axon.

The accepted view of the neuron attributes dedicated functions to its various anatomical components; however, dendrites and axons often act in ways contrary to their so-called main function.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-01-14 |title=16.7: Nervous System |url=https://bio.libretexts.org/Courses/Lumen_Learning/Book%3A_Fundamentals_of_Biology_I_(Lumen)/16%3A_Module_13%3A_Overview_of_Body_Systems/16.7%3A_Nervous_System |access-date=2022-02-28 |website=Biology LibreTexts |language=en}}</ref>

[[File:BN1 Neurology.webm|thumb|Neurology video]]

Axons and dendrites in the central nervous system are typically only about one micrometer thick, while some in the peripheral nervous system are much thicker. The soma is usually about 10–25 micrometers in diameter and often is not much larger than the cell nucleus it contains. The longest axon of a human [[motor neuron]] can be over a meter long, reaching from the base of the spine to the toes.

Sensory neurons can have axons that run from the toes to the [[posterior column]] of the spinal cord, over 1.5 meters in adults. [[Giraffe]]s have single axons several meters in length running along the entire length of their necks. Much of what is known about axonal function comes from studying the [[squid giant axon]], an ideal experimental preparation because of its relatively immense size (0.5–1 millimeter thick, several centimeters long).

Fully differentiated neurons are permanently [[G0 phase|postmitotic]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Herrup K, Yang Y | title = Cell cycle regulation in the postmitotic neuron: oxymoron or new biology? | journal = Nature Reviews. Neuroscience | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 368–78 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17453017 | doi = 10.1038/nrn2124 | s2cid = 12908713 }}</ref> however, stem cells present in the adult brain may regenerate functional neurons throughout the life of an organism (see [[neurogenesis]]). [[Astrocyte]]s are star-shaped [[glial cell]]s. They have been observed to turn into neurons by virtue of their stem cell-like characteristic of [[pluripotency]].

===Membrane===
Like all animal cells, the cell body of every neuron is enclosed by a [[plasma membrane]], a bilayer of [[lipid]] molecules with many types of protein structures embedded in it.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Giménez |first=C. |date=February 1998 |title=[Composition and structure of the neuronal membrane: molecular basis of its physiology and pathology] |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9563093/ |journal=Revista de Neurologia |volume=26 |issue=150 |pages=232–239 |issn=0210-0010 |pmid=9563093}}</ref> A lipid bilayer is a powerful electrical [[Insulator (electricity)|insulator]], but in neurons, many of the protein structures embedded in the membrane are electrically active. These include ion channels that permit electrically charged ions to flow across the membrane and ion pumps that chemically transport ions from one side of the membrane to the other. Most ion channels are permeable only to specific types of ions. Some ion channels are [[voltage-gated ion channel|voltage gated]], meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by altering the voltage difference across the membrane. Others are chemically gated, meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by interactions with chemicals that diffuse through the extracellular fluid. The [[ion]] materials include [[sodium]], [[potassium]], [[chloride]], and [[calcium]]. The interactions between ion channels and ion pumps produce a voltage difference across the membrane, typically a bit less than 1/10 of a volt at baseline. This voltage has two functions: first, it provides a power source for an assortment of voltage-dependent protein machinery that is embedded in the membrane; second, it provides a basis for electrical signal transmission between different parts of the membrane.

===Histology and internal structure===

[[Image:SUM 110913 Cort Neurons 2.5d in vitro 488 Phalloidin no perm 4 cmle-2.png|thumb|300px|Actin filaments in a mouse cortical neuron in culture]]

Numerous microscopic clumps called [[Nissl body|Nissl bodies]] (or Nissl substance) are seen when nerve cell bodies are stained with a basophilic ("base-loving") dye. These structures consist of [[Endoplasmic reticulum#Rough endoplasmic reticulum|rough endoplasmic reticulum]] and associated [[ribosomal RNA]]. Named after German psychiatrist and neuropathologist [[Franz Nissl]] (1860–1919), they are involved in protein synthesis and their prominence can be explained by the fact that nerve cells are very metabolically active. Basophilic dyes such as [[aniline]] or (weakly) [[haematoxylin]]<ref>{{cite book|title=State Hospitals Bulletin|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Wp8CAAAAYAAJ|page=378}}|year=1897|publisher=State Commission in Lunacy.|page=378}}</ref> highlight negatively charged components, and so bind to the phosphate backbone of the ribosomal RNA.

The cell body of a neuron is supported by a complex mesh of structural proteins called [[neurofilament]]s, which together with neurotubules (neuronal microtubules) are assembled into larger neurofibrils.<ref name="Webster">{{cite web |title=Medical Definition of Neurotubules |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/neurotubules |website=www.merriam-webster.com}}</ref> Some neurons also contain pigment granules, such as [[neuromelanin]] (a brownish-black pigment that is byproduct of synthesis of [[catecholamine]]s), and [[lipofuscin]] (a yellowish-brown pigment), both of which accumulate with age.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zecca L, Gallorini M, Schünemann V, Trautwein AX, Gerlach M, Riederer P, Vezzoni P, Tampellini D | title = Iron, neuromelanin and ferritin content in the substantia nigra of normal subjects at different ages: consequences for iron storage and neurodegenerative processes | journal = Journal of Neurochemistry | volume = 76 | issue = 6 | pages = 1766–73 | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11259494 | doi = 10.1046/j.1471-4159.2001.00186.x | s2cid = 31301135 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Herrero MT, Hirsch EC, Kastner A, Luquin MR, Javoy-Agid F, Gonzalo LM, Obeso JA, Agid Y | title = Neuromelanin accumulation with age in catecholaminergic neurons from Macaca fascicularis brainstem | journal = Developmental Neuroscience | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–48 | date = 1993 | pmid = 7505739 | doi = 10.1159/000111315 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunk UT, Terman A | title = Lipofuscin: mechanisms of age-related accumulation and influence on cell function | journal = Free Radical Biology & Medicine | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 611–9 | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12208347 | doi = 10.1016/s0891-5849(02)00959-0 }}</ref> Other structural proteins that are important for neuronal function are [[actin]] and the [[tubulin]] of [[microtubule]]s. [[Class III β-tubulin]] is found almost exclusively in neurons. Actin is predominately found at the tips of axons and dendrites during neuronal development. There the actin dynamics can be modulated via an interplay with microtubule.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhao B, Meka DP, Scharrenberg R, König T, Schwanke B, Kobler O, Windhorst S, Kreutz MR, Mikhaylova M, Calderon de Anda F | title = Microtubules Modulate F-actin Dynamics during Neuronal Polarization | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 9583 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28851982 | pmc = 5575062 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-017-09832-8 | bibcode = 2017NatSR...7.9583Z }}</ref>

There are different internal structural characteristics between axons and dendrites. Typical axons almost never contain [[ribosomes]], except some in the initial segment. Dendrites contain granular endoplasmic reticulum or ribosomes, in diminishing amounts as the distance from the cell body increases.

The dendritic tree wraps around the cell body and receives signals from other neurons. The end of the axon has branching [[axon terminal]]s that release neurotransmitters into a gap called the [[synaptic cleft]] between the terminals and the dendrites of the next neuron.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

====Polarity====
[[File:Neurons uni bi multi pseudouni.svg|thumb|Different kinds of neurons:<br />1 [[Unipolar neuron]]<br />2 [[Bipolar neuron]]<br />3 [[Multipolar neuron]]<br />4 [[Pseudounipolar neuron]] ]]
Most neurons can be anatomically characterized as:<ref name="Openstax Anatomy & Physiology attribution">{{CC-notice|cc=by4|url=https://openstax.org/books/anatomy-and-physiology/pages/12-2-nervous-tissue}} {{cite book|last1=Betts|first1=J Gordon|last2=Desaix|first2=Peter|last3=Johnson|first3=Eddie|last4=Johnson|first4=Jody E|last5=Korol|first5=Oksana|last6=Kruse|first6=Dean|last7=Poe|first7=Brandon|last8=Wise|first8=James|last9=Womble|first9=Mark D|last10=Young|first10=Kelly A|title=Anatomy & Physiology|location=Houston|publisher=OpenStax CNX|isbn=978-1-947172-04-3|date=June 8, 2023|at=12.2 Nervous tissue}}</ref>
* [[Unipolar neuron|Unipolar]]: single process. Unipolar cells are exclusively sensory neurons. Their dendrites are receiving sensory information, sometimes directly from the stimulus itself. The cell bodies of unipolar neurons are always found in ganglia. Sensory reception is a peripheral function, so the cell body is in the periphery, though closer to the CNS in a ganglion. The axon projects from the dendrite endings, past the cell body in a ganglion, and into the central nervous system.
* [[Bipolar cell|Bipolar]]: 1 axon and 1 dendrite. They are found mainly in the [[olfactory epithelium]], and as part of the retina.
* [[Multipolar neuron|Multipolar]]: 1 axon and 2 or more dendrites
** [[Golgi I]]: neurons with long-projecting axonal processes; examples are pyramidal cells, Purkinje cells, and anterior horn cells
** [[Golgi II]]: neurons whose axonal process projects locally; the best example is the granule cell
* [[Anaxonic neuron|Anaxonic]]: where the axon cannot be distinguished from the dendrite(s)
* [[Pseudounipolar cells|Pseudounipolar]]: 1 process which then serves as both an axon and a dendrite

====Other====
Some unique neuronal types can be identified according to their location in the nervous system and distinct shape. Some examples are:{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}
* [[Basket cell]]s, interneurons that form a dense plexus of terminals around the soma of target cells, found in the cortex and [[cerebellum]]
* [[Betz cell]]s, large motor neurons
* [[Lugaro cell]]s, interneurons of the cerebellum
* [[Medium spiny neuron]]s, most neurons in the [[corpus striatum]]
* [[Purkinje cell]]s, huge neurons in the cerebellum, a type of Golgi I multipolar neuron
* [[Pyramidal cell]]s, neurons with triangular soma, a type of Golgi I
* [[Rosehip neuron|Rosehip cells]], unique human inhibitory neurons that interconnect with Pyramidal cells
* [[Renshaw cell]]s, neurons with both ends linked to [[alpha motor neuron]]s
* [[Unipolar brush cell]]s, interneurons with unique dendrite ending in a brush-like tuft
* [[Granule cell]]s, a type of Golgi II neuron
* [[Anterior horn (spinal cord)|Anterior horn]] cells, [[motoneurons]] located in the spinal cord
* [[Spindle cell]]s, interneurons that connect widely separated areas of the brain

===Functional classification===

====Direction====
* [[Afferent neuron]]s convey information from tissues and organs into the central nervous system and are also called [[sensory neurons]].
* [[Efferent neuron]]s (motor neurons) transmit signals from the central nervous system to the effector cells.
* [[Interneuron]]s connect neurons within specific regions of the central nervous system.

Afferent and efferent also refer generally to neurons that, respectively, bring information to or send information from the brain.

====Action on other neurons====
A neuron affects other neurons by releasing a neurotransmitter that binds to [[receptor (biochemistry)|chemical receptor]]s. The effect upon the postsynaptic neuron is determined by the type of receptor that is activated, not by the presynaptic neuron or by the neurotransmitter. A neurotransmitter can be thought of as a key, and a receptor as a lock: the same neurotransmitter can activate multiple types of receptors. Receptors can be classified broadly as ''excitatory'' (causing an increase in firing rate), ''inhibitory'' (causing a decrease in firing rate), or ''modulatory'' (causing long-lasting effects not directly related to firing rate).{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

The two most common (90%+) neurotransmitters in the brain, [[glutamate]] and [[GABA]], have largely consistent actions. Glutamate acts on several types of receptors, and has effects that are excitatory at [[ionotropic receptor]]s and a modulatory effect at [[metabotropic receptor]]s. Similarly, GABA acts on several types of receptors, but all of them have inhibitory effects (in adult animals, at least). Because of this consistency, it is common for neuroscientists to refer to cells that release glutamate as "excitatory neurons", and cells that release GABA as "inhibitory neurons". Some other types of neurons have consistent effects, for example, "excitatory" motor neurons in the spinal cord that release [[acetylcholine]], and "inhibitory" [[spinal neuron]]s that release [[glycine]].{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

The distinction between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters is not absolute. Rather, it depends on the class of chemical receptors present on the postsynaptic neuron. In principle, a single neuron, releasing a single neurotransmitter, can have excitatory effects on some targets, inhibitory effects on others, and modulatory effects on others still. For example, [[photoreceptor cell]]s in the retina constantly release the neurotransmitter glutamate in the absence of light. So-called OFF [[retinal bipolar cells|bipolar cells]] are, like most neurons, excited by the released glutamate. However, neighboring target neurons called ON bipolar cells are instead inhibited by glutamate, because they lack typical [[ionotropic receptor|ionotropic]] [[glutamate receptors]] and instead express a class of inhibitory [[metabotropic receptor|metabotropic]] glutamate receptors.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gerber U | title = Metabotropic glutamate receptors in vertebrate retina | journal = Documenta Ophthalmologica. Advances in Ophthalmology | volume = 106 | issue = 1 | pages = 83–7 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12675489 | doi = 10.1023/A:1022477203420 | s2cid = 22296630 }}</ref> When light is present, the photoreceptors cease releasing glutamate, which relieves the ON bipolar cells from inhibition, activating them; this simultaneously removes the excitation from the OFF bipolar cells, silencing them.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

It is possible to identify the type of inhibitory effect a presynaptic neuron will have on a postsynaptic neuron, based on the proteins the presynaptic neuron expresses. [[Parvalbumin]]-expressing neurons typically dampen the output signal of the postsynaptic neuron in the [[visual cortex]], whereas [[somatostatin]]-expressing neurons typically block dendritic inputs to the postsynaptic neuron.<ref name="pmid22878717">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilson NR, Runyan CA, Wang FL, Sur M | title = Division and subtraction by distinct cortical inhibitory networks in vivo | journal = Nature | volume = 488 | issue = 7411 | pages = 343–8 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22878717 | pmc = 3653570 | doi = 10.1038/nature11347 | bibcode = 2012Natur.488..343W | hdl = 1721.1/92709 }}</ref>

====Discharge patterns====
Neurons have intrinsic electroresponsive properties like intrinsic transmembrane voltage [[Neural oscillation|oscillatory]] patterns.<ref name="llinas2014">{{cite journal | vauthors = Llinás RR | title = Intrinsic electrical properties of mammalian neurons and CNS function: a historical perspective | journal = Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | volume = 8 | pages = 320 | date = 2014-01-01 | pmid = 25408634 | pmc = 4219458 | doi = 10.3389/fncel.2014.00320 | doi-access = free }}</ref> So neurons can be classified according to their [[electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] characteristics:
* Tonic or regular spiking. Some neurons are typically constantly (tonically) active, typically firing at a constant frequency. Example: interneurons in [[striatum|neurostriatum]].
* Phasic or [[bursting]]. Neurons that fire in bursts are called phasic.
* Fast-spiking. Some neurons are notable for their high firing rates, for example some types of cortical inhibitory interneurons, cells in [[globus pallidus]], [[retinal ganglion cells]].<ref>{{cite conference | title = Ion conductances related to shaping the repetitive firing in rat retinal ganglion cells | vauthors = Kolodin YO, Veselovskaia NN, Veselovsky NS, Fedulova SA | conference = Acta Physiologica Congress | url = http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/aphmeeting/abstract.asp?MeetingID=&id=61198 | access-date = 2009-06-20 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121007164451/http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/aphmeeting/abstract.asp?MeetingID=&id=61198 | archive-date = 2012-10-07 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ykolodin.50webs.com/ |title=Ionic conductances underlying excitability in tonically firing retinal ganglion cells of adult rat |publisher=Ykolodin.50webs.com |date=2008-04-27 |access-date=2013-02-16}}</ref>

====Neurotransmitter====
[[File:Neurotransmitters.jpg|thumb|Synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitters]]
{{Main|Neurotransmitter}}
[[Neurotransmitter]]s are chemical messengers passed from one neuron to another neuron or to a [[muscle cell]] or [[Gland|gland cell]].
* Cholinergic neurons – acetylcholine. [[Acetylcholine]] is released from presynaptic neurons into the synaptic cleft. It acts as a [[ligand]] for both ligand-gated ion channels and [[Metabotropic receptor|metabotropic]] (GPCRs) [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor|muscarinic receptors]]. [[Nicotinic receptors]] are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels composed of alpha and beta subunits that bind [[nicotine]]. Ligand binding opens the channel causing influx of [[Sodium|Na<sup>+</sup>]] depolarization and increases the probability of presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Acetylcholine is synthesized from [[choline]] and [[acetyl coenzyme A]].
* Adrenergic neurons – noradrenaline. [[Noradrenaline]] (norepinephrine) is released from most [[postganglionic]] neurons in the [[sympathetic nervous system]] onto two sets of GPCRs: [[Adrenergic receptor|alpha adrenoceptor]]s and [[beta adrenoceptor]]s. Noradrenaline is one of the three common [[catecholamine]] neurotransmitter, and the most prevalent of them in the [[peripheral nervous system]]; as with other catecholamines, it is synthesised from [[tyrosine]].
* GABAergic neurons – [[gamma aminobutyric acid]]. GABA is one of two neuroinhibitors in the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), along with glycine. GABA has a homologous function to [[Acetylcholine|ACh]], gating anion channels that allow [[Chlorine|Cl<sup>−</sup>]] ions to enter the post synaptic neuron. Cl<sup>−</sup> causes hyperpolarization within the neuron, decreasing the probability of an action potential firing as the voltage becomes more negative (for an action potential to fire, a positive voltage threshold must be reached). GABA is synthesized from glutamate neurotransmitters by the enzyme [[glutamate decarboxylase]].
* Glutamatergic neurons – glutamate. [[Glutamate]] is one of two primary excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters, along with [[Aspartic acid|aspartate]]. Glutamate receptors are one of four categories, three of which are ligand-gated ion channels and one of which is a [[G protein|G-protein]] coupled receptor (often referred to as GPCR).

:#[[AMPA]] and [[Kainic acid|Kainate]] receptors function as [[Ion|cation]] channels permeable to Na<sup>+</sup> cation channels mediating fast excitatory synaptic transmission.
:#[[N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid|NMDA]] receptors are another cation channel that is more permeable to [[Calcium in biology|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]]. The function of NMDA receptors depend on glycine receptor binding as a co-[[agonist]] within the channel pore. NMDA receptors do not function without both ligands present.
:#Metabotropic receptors, GPCRs modulate synaptic transmission and postsynaptic excitability.
::Glutamate can cause excitotoxicity when blood flow to the brain is interrupted, resulting in [[brain damage]]. When blood flow is suppressed, glutamate is released from presynaptic neurons, causing greater NMDA and AMPA receptor activation than normal outside of stress conditions, leading to elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> entering the post synaptic neuron and cell damage. Glutamate is synthesized from the amino acid glutamine by the enzyme [[Glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase|glutamate synthase]].
* Dopaminergic neurons—[[dopamine]]. [[Dopamine]] is a neurotransmitter that acts on D1 type (D1 and D5) Gs-coupled receptors, which increase cAMP and PKA, and D2 type (D2, D3, and D4) receptors, which activate Gi-coupled receptors that decrease cAMP and PKA. Dopamine is connected to mood and behavior and modulates both pre- and post-synaptic neurotransmission. Loss of dopamine neurons in the [[substantia nigra]] has been linked to [[Parkinson's disease]]. Dopamine is synthesized from the amino acid [[tyrosine]]. Tyrosine is catalyzed into levodopa (or [[L-DOPA]]) by [[Tyrosine hydroxylase|tyrosine hydroxlase]], and levodopa is then converted into dopamine by the aromatic amino acid [[Carboxy-lyases|decarboxylase]].
* Serotonergic neurons—[[serotonin]]. [[Serotonin]] (5-Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) can act as excitatory or inhibitory. Of its four 5-HT receptor classes, 3 are GPCR and 1 is a ligand-gated cation channel. Serotonin is synthesized from [[tryptophan]] by [[tryptophan hydroxylase]], and then further by decarboxylase. A lack of 5-HT at postsynaptic neurons has been linked to depression. Drugs that block the presynaptic [[serotonin transporter]] are used for treatment, such as [[Prozac]] and [[Zoloft]].
* Purinergic neurons—ATP. [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] is a neurotransmitter acting at both ligand-gated ion channels ([[P2X]] receptors) and GPCRs ([[P2Y receptor|P2Y]]) receptors. ATP is, however, best known as a [[cotransmitter]]. Such [[purinergic signalling]] can also be mediated by other [[purine]]s like [[adenosine]], which particularly acts at P2Y receptors.
* Histaminergic neurons—[[histamine]]. [[Histamine]] is a [[monoamine neurotransmitter]] and [[neuromodulator]]. Histamine-producing neurons are found in the [[tuberomammillary nucleus]] of the [[hypothalamus]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Scammell TE, Jackson AC, Franks NP, Wisden W, Dauvilliers Y | title = Histamine: neural circuits and new medications | journal = Sleep | volume = 42 | issue = 1 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 30239935 | pmc = 6335869 | doi = 10.1093/sleep/zsy183 }}</ref> Histamine is involved in [[arousal]] and regulating sleep/wake behaviors.

====Multimodel classification====
Since 2012 there has been a push from the cellular and [[computational neuroscience]] community to come up with a universal classification of neurons that will apply to all neurons in the brain as well as across species. This is done by considering the three essential qualities of all neurons: electrophysiology, morphology, and the individual transcriptome of the cells. Besides being universal this classification has the advantage of being able to classify astrocytes as well. A method called [[patch-sequencing]] in which all three qualities can be measured at once is used extensively by the [[Allen Institute for Brain Science]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.news-medical.net/news/20201203/Patch-seq-technique-helps-depict-the-variation-of-neural-cells-in-the-brain.aspx |title=Patch-seq technique helps depict the variation of neural cells in the brain |work=News-medical.net |date=3 December 2020 |access-date=26 August 2021 }}</ref> In 2023, a comprehensive cell atlas of the adult, and developing human brain at the transcriptional, epigenetic, and functional levels was created through an international collaboration of researchers using the most cutting-edge molecular biology approaches.<ref> {{Cite web

[[File:Chemical synapse schema cropped.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A signal propagating down an axon to the cell body and dendrites of the next cell]]
[[File:Neuro Muscular Junction.png|thumb|Chemical synapse|left]]
Neurons communicate with each other via [[synapses]], where either the [[axon terminal]] of one cell contacts another neuron's dendrite, soma or, less commonly, axon. Neurons such as Purkinje cells in the cerebellum can have over 1000 dendritic branches, making connections with tens of thousands of other cells; other neurons, such as the magnocellular neurons of the [[supraoptic nucleus]], have only one or two dendrites, each of which receives thousands of synapses.

Synapses can be excitatory or inhibitory, either increasing or decreasing activity in the target neuron, respectively. Some neurons also communicate via electrical synapses, which are direct, electrically conductive [[gap junction|junctions]] between cells.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Macpherson |first1=Gordon |title=Black's Medical Dictionary |date=2002 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |location=Lanham, MD |isbn=0810849844 |pages=431–434 |edition=40 }}</ref>

When an action potential reaches the axon terminal, it opens [[Voltage-dependent calcium channel|voltage-gated calcium channels]], allowing [[Calcium in biology|calcium ions]] to enter the terminal. Calcium causes [[synaptic vesicles]] filled with neurotransmitter molecules to fuse with the membrane, releasing their contents into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters diffuse across the synaptic cleft and activate receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. High cytosolic calcium in the [[axon terminal]] triggers mitochondrial calcium uptake, which, in turn, activates mitochondrial [[energy metabolism]] to produce [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to support continuous neurotransmission.<ref name="pmid23746507">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ivannikov MV, Macleod GT | title = Mitochondrial free Ca²⁺ levels and their effects on energy metabolism in Drosophila motor nerve terminals | journal = Biophysical Journal | volume = 104 | issue = 11 | pages = 2353–61 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23746507 | pmc = 3672877 | doi = 10.1016/j.bpj.2013.03.064 | bibcode = 2013BpJ...104.2353I }}</ref>

==Mechanisms for propagating action potentials==
In 1937 [[John Zachary Young]] suggested that the [[squid giant axon]] could be used to study neuronal electrical properties.<ref>{{cite web |first = Eric H. |last = Chudler | name-list-style = vanc |title = Milestones in Neuroscience Research |url = http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/hist.html |work = Neuroscience for Kids |access-date = 2009-06-20}}</ref> It is larger than but similar to human neurons, making it easier to study. By inserting electrodes into the squid giant axons, accurate measurements were made of the [[membrane potential]].

The cell membrane of the axon and soma contain voltage-gated ion channels that allow the neuron to generate and propagate an electrical signal (an action potential). Some neurons also generate [[subthreshold membrane potential oscillations]]. These signals are generated and propagated by charge-carrying [[ions]] including sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>), potassium (K<sup>+</sup>), chloride (Cl<sup>−</sup>), and [[Calcium signaling|calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)]].

Several stimuli can activate a neuron leading to electrical activity, including [[Mechanoreceptor|pressure]], stretch, chemical transmitters, and changes of the electric potential across the cell membrane.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Joe |last1=Patlak |first2=Ray |last2=Gibbons | name-list-style = vanc |title=Electrical Activity of Nerves |url=http://physioweb.med.uvm.edu/cardiacep/EP/nervecells.htm |work=Action Potentials in Nerve Cells |date=2000-11-01 |access-date=2009-06-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827220335/http://physioweb.med.uvm.edu/cardiacep/EP/nervecells.htm |archive-date=August 27, 2009 }}</ref> Stimuli cause specific ion-channels within the cell membrane to open, leading to a flow of ions through the cell membrane, changing the membrane potential.

Thin neurons and axons require less [[metabolism|metabolic]] expense to produce and carry action potentials, but thicker axons convey impulses more rapidly. To minimize metabolic expense while maintaining rapid conduction, many neurons have insulating sheaths of [[myelin]] around their axons. The sheaths are formed by [[glia]]l cells: [[oligodendrocyte]]s in the central nervous system and [[Schwann cell]]s in the peripheral nervous system. The sheath enables action potentials to travel [[saltatory conduction|faster]] than in unmyelinated axons of the same diameter, whilst using less energy. The myelin sheath in peripheral nerves normally runs along the axon in sections about 1&nbsp;mm long, punctuated by unsheathed [[node of Ranvier|nodes of Ranvier]], which contain a high density of voltage-gated ion channels. [[Multiple sclerosis]] is a neurological disorder that results from demyelination of axons in the central nervous system.

Some neurons do not generate action potentials, but instead generate a [[graded potential|graded electrical signal]], which in turn causes graded neurotransmitter release. Such [[non-spiking neurons]] tend to be sensory neurons or interneurons, because they cannot carry signals long distances.

==Neural coding==
[[Neural coding]] is concerned with how sensory and other information is represented in the brain by neurons. The main goal of studying neural coding is to characterize the relationship between the [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] and the individual or [[Neural ensemble|ensemble]] neuronal responses, and the relationships among the electrical activities of the neurons within the ensemble.<ref name="Brown">{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown EN, Kass RE, Mitra PP | title = Multiple neural spike train data analysis: state-of-the-art and future challenges | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 456–61 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15114358 | doi = 10.1038/nn1228 | s2cid = 562815 }}</ref> It is thought that neurons can encode both [[Digital data|digital]] and [[analog signal|analog]] information.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Thorpe SJ |chapter=Spike arrival times: A highly efficient coding scheme for neural networks |chapter-url= http://pop.cerco.ups-tlse.fr/fr_vers/documents/thorpe_sj_90_91.pdf |pages= 91–94 |title=Parallel processing in neural systems and computers| veditors = Eckmiller R, Hartmann G, Hauske G |date=1990|publisher=North-Holland|isbn=9780444883902 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=boBqAAAAMAAJ}}|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215151304/http://pop.cerco.ups-tlse.fr/fr_vers/documents/thorpe_sj_90_91.pdf|archive-date=2012-02-15}}</ref>

==All-or-none principle==
[[File:All-or-none law en.svg|thumb|318x318px|As long as the stimulus reaches the threshold, the full response would be given.

{{Main|All-or-none law}}
The conduction of nerve impulses is an example of an [[All-or-none law|all-or-none]] response. In other words, if a neuron responds at all, then it must respond completely. Greater intensity of stimulation, like brighter image/louder sound, does not produce a stronger signal, but can increase firing frequency.<ref name="Kalat, James W-2016" />{{Rp|31}} Receptors respond in different ways to stimuli. Slowly adapting or [[tonic (physiology)|tonic receptors]] respond to steady stimulus and produce a steady rate of firing. Tonic receptors most often respond to increased intensity of stimulus by increasing their firing frequency, usually as a power function of stimulus plotted against impulses per second. This can be likened to an intrinsic property of light where greater intensity of a specific frequency (color) requires more photons, as the photons can not become "stronger" for a specific frequency.

Other receptor types include quickly adapting or phasic receptors, where firing decreases or stops with steady stimulus; examples include [[Human skin|skin]] which, when touched causes neurons to fire, but if the object maintains even pressure, the neurons stop firing. The neurons of the skin and muscles that are responsive to pressure and vibration have filtering accessory structures that aid their function.

The [[pacinian corpuscle]] is one such structure. It has concentric layers like an onion, which form around the axon terminal. When pressure is applied and the corpuscle is deformed, mechanical stimulus is transferred to the axon, which fires. If the pressure is steady, stimulus ends; thus, typically these neurons respond with a transient depolarization during the initial deformation and again when the pressure is removed, which causes the corpuscle to change shape again. Other types of adaptation are important in extending the function of a number of other neurons.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Eckert | first1 = Roger | last2 = Randall | first2 = David | name-list-style = vanc | title = Animal physiology: mechanisms and adaptations | year = 1983 | publisher = W.H.

===Neuron doctrine===
[[File:PurkinjeCell.jpg|thumb|Drawing of neurons in the pigeon [[cerebellum]], by Spanish neuroscientist [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]] in 1899. (A) denotes [[Purkinje cell]]s and (B) denotes [[granule cells]], both of which are multipolar.]]
The neuron doctrine is the now fundamental idea that neurons are the basic structural and functional units of the nervous system. The theory was put forward by Santiago Ramón y Cajal in the late 19th century. It held that neurons are discrete cells (not connected in a meshwork), acting as metabolically distinct units.

Later discoveries yielded refinements to the doctrine. For example, [[Neuroglia|glial cells]], which are non-neuronal, play an essential role in information processing.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Witcher MR, Kirov SA, Harris KM | title = Plasticity of perisynaptic astroglia during synaptogenesis in the mature rat hippocampus | journal = Glia | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–23 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17001633 | doi = 10.1002/glia.20415 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.598.7002 | s2cid = 10664003 }}</ref> Also, electrical synapses are more common than previously thought,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Connors BW, Long MA | title = Electrical synapses in the mammalian brain | journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 393–418 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15217338 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.neuro.26.041002.131128 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/894386 }}</ref> comprising direct, cytoplasmic connections between neurons. In fact, neurons can form even tighter couplings: the squid giant axon arises from the fusion of multiple axons.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Guillery RW | title = Observations of synaptic structures: origins of the neuron doctrine and its current status | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Ramón y Cajal also postulated the Law of Dynamic Polarization, which states that a neuron receives signals at its dendrites and cell body and transmits them, as action potentials, along the axon in one direction: away from the cell body.<ref name="sabb">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sabbatini RM | date = April–July 2003 | url = http://www.cerebromente.org.br/n17/history/neurons3_i.htm | title = Neurons and Synapses: The History of Its Discovery | journal = Brain & Mind Magazine | pages = 17 }}</ref> The Law of Dynamic Polarization has important exceptions; dendrites can serve as synaptic output sites of neurons<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Djurisic M, Antic S, Chen WR, Zecevic D | title = Voltage imaging from dendrites of mitral cells: EPSP attenuation and spike trigger zones | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 24 | issue = 30 | pages = 6703–14 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15282273 | pmc = 6729725 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0307-04.2004 | hdl = 1912/2958 }}

===Compartmental modelling of neurons===
Although neurons are often described of as "fundamental units" of the brain, they perform internal computations. Neurons integrate input within dendrites, and this complexity is lost in models that assume neurons to be a fundamental unit. Dendritic branches can be modeled as spatial compartments, whose activity is related due to passive membrane properties, but may also be different depending on input from synapses. [[Compartmental modelling of dendrites]] is especially helpful for understanding the behavior of neurons that are too small to record with electrodes, as is the case for ''Drosophila melanogaster''.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gouwens NW, Wilson RI | title = Signal propagation in Drosophila central neurons | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 29 | issue = 19 | pages = 6239–6249 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19439602 | pmc = 2709801 | doi = 10.1523/jneurosci.0764-09.2009 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

==Neurons in the brain==
The number of neurons in the brain varies dramatically from species to species.<ref name="nervenet">{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams RW, Herrup K | title = The control of neuron number | journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 423–53 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3284447 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ne.11.030188.002231 }}</ref> In a human, there are an estimated 10–20 billion neurons in the [[cerebral cortex]]<!--<ref name="pmid27187682" />--> and 55–70 billion neurons in the [[cerebellum]].<ref name="pmid27187682">{{cite journal | vauthors = von Bartheld CS, Bahney J, Herculano-Houzel S | title = The search for true numbers of neurons and glial cells in the human brain: A review of 150 years of cell counting | journal = The Journal of Comparative Neurology | volume = 524 | issue = 18 | pages = 3865–3895 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27187682 | pmc = 5063692 | doi = 10.1002/cne.24040 }}</ref> By contrast, the [[nematode]] worm ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' has just 302 neurons, making it an ideal [[model organism]] as scientists have been able to map all of its neurons. The fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', a common subject in biological experiments, has around 100,000 neurons and exhibits many complex behaviors. Many properties of neurons, from the type of neurotransmitters used to ion channel composition, are maintained across species, allowing scientists to study processes occurring in more complex organisms in much simpler experimental systems.

==Neurological disorders==
{{Main|Neurological disorders}}
{{More citations needed|date=May 2018}}
[[Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease]] (CMT) is a heterogeneous inherited disorder of nerves ([[neuropathy]]) that is characterized by loss of muscle tissue and touch sensation, predominantly in the feet and legs extending to the hands and arms in advanced stages. Presently incurable, this disease is one of the most common inherited [[neurological disorder]]s, affecting 36 in 100,000 people.<ref name=Krajewski>{{cite journal | vauthors = Krajewski KM, Lewis RA, Fuerst DR, Turansky C, Hinderer SR, Garbern J, Kamholz J, Shy ME | title = Neurological dysfunction and axonal degeneration in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A | journal = Brain | volume = 123 | issue = 7 | pages = 1516–27 | date = July 2000 | pmid = 10869062 | doi = 10.1093/brain/123.7.1516 | doi-access =  }}</ref>

[[Alzheimer's disease]] (AD), also known simply as ''Alzheimer's'', is a [[neurodegenerative disease]] characterized by progressive [[cognitive]] deterioration, together with declining activities of daily living and [[neuropsychiatric]] symptoms or behavioral changes.<ref name="nihstages">{{cite web|title=About Alzheimer's Disease: Symptoms|url=http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/topics/symptoms|publisher=National Institute on Aging|access-date=28 December 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115201854/http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/topics/symptoms|archive-date=15 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The most striking early symptom is loss of short-term memory ([[amnesia]]), which usually manifests as minor forgetfulness that becomes steadily more pronounced with illness progression, with relative preservation of older memories. As the disorder progresses, cognitive (intellectual) impairment extends to the domains of language ([[aphasia]]), skilled movements ([[apraxia]]), and recognition ([[agnosia]]), and functions such as decision-making and planning become impaired.<ref name="BMJ2009">{{cite journal | vauthors = Burns A, Iliffe S | title = Alzheimer's disease | journal = BMJ | volume = 338 | pages = b158 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19196745 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.b158 | s2cid = 8570146 }}</ref><ref name=NEJM2010>{{cite journal | vauthors = Querfurth HW, LaFerla FM | title = Alzheimer's disease | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 362 | issue = 4 | pages = 329–44 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20107219 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra0909142 | s2cid = 205115756 }}</ref>

[[Parkinson's disease]] (PD), also known as ''Parkinsons'', is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that often impairs motor skills and speech.<ref name=NIH2016>{{cite web|title=Parkinson's Disease Information Page|url=https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Parkinsons-Disease-Information-Page|website=NINDS|access-date=18 July 2016|date=30 June 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104201403/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Parkinsons-Disease-Information-Page|archive-date=4 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Parkinson's disease belongs to a group of conditions called [[movement disorders]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Movement Disorders| url = http://www.neuromodulation.com/movement-disorders | work = The International Neuromodulation Society }}</ref> It is characterized by muscle rigidity, [[tremor]], a slowing of physical movement ([[bradykinesia]]), and in extreme cases, a loss of physical movement ([[akinesia]]). The primary symptoms are the results of decreased stimulation of the [[motor cortex]] by the [[basal ganglia]], normally caused by the insufficient formation and action of dopamine, which is produced in the [[dopaminergic neurons]] of the brain. Secondary symptoms may include high level [[cognitive dysfunction]] and subtle language problems. PD is both chronic and progressive.

[[Myasthenia gravis]] is a [[neuromuscular disease]] leading to fluctuating [[muscle weakness]] and fatigability during simple activities. Weakness is typically caused by circulating [[antibodies]] that block [[acetylcholine receptors]] at the post-synaptic neuromuscular junction, inhibiting the stimulative effect of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Myasthenia is treated with [[immunosuppressants]], [[cholinesterase]] inhibitors and, in selected cases, [[thymectomy]].

===Demyelination===
{{Further|Demyelinating disease}}
[[File:Guillain-barré syndrome - Nerve Damage.gif|thumb|[[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] – demyelination]]
[[Demyelination]] is a process characterized by the gradual loss of the myelin sheath enveloping nerve fibers. When myelin deteriorates, signal conduction along nerves can be significantly impaired or lost, and the nerve eventually withers. Demyelination may affect both central and peripheral nervous systems, contributing to various neurological disorders such as [[multiple sclerosis]], [[Guillain–Barré syndrome|Guillain-Barré syndrome]], and [[chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy]]. Although demyelination is often caused by an [[Autoimmunity|autoimmune]] reaction, it may also be caused by viral infections, metabolic disorders, trauma, and some medications. 

===Axonal degeneration===
Although most injury responses include a calcium influx signaling to promote resealing of severed parts, axonal injuries initially lead to acute [[axonal degeneration]], which is the rapid separation of the proximal and distal ends, occurring within 30 minutes of injury.<ref name="NM">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerschensteiner M, Schwab ME, Lichtman JW, Misgeld T | s2cid = 25287010 | title = In vivo imaging of axonal degeneration and regeneration in the injured spinal cord | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 572–7 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15821747 | doi = 10.1038/nm1229 }}</ref> Degeneration follows with swelling of the [[axolemma]], and eventually leads to bead-like formation. Granular disintegration of the axonal [[cytoskeleton]] and inner [[organelle]]s occurs after axolemma degradation. Early changes include accumulation of [[mitochondria]] in the paranodal regions at the site of injury. Endoplasmic reticulum degrades and mitochondria swell up and eventually disintegrate. The disintegration is dependent on [[ubiquitin]] and [[calpain]] [[proteases]] (caused by the influx of calcium ion), suggesting that axonal degeneration is an active process that produces complete fragmentation. The process takes about roughly 24 hours in the PNS and longer in the CNS. The signaling pathways leading to axolemma degeneration are unknown.

==Neurogenesis==
{{Main|Neurogenesis}}
Neurons are born through the process of [[neurogenesis]], in which [[neural stem cell]]s divide to produce differentiated neurons. Once fully differentiated neurons are formed, they are no longer capable of undergoing [[mitosis]]. Neurogenesis primarily occurs in the embryo of most organisms.

[[Adult neurogenesis]] can occur and studies of the age of human neurons suggest that this process occurs only for a minority of cells, and that the vast majority of neurons in the [[neocortex]] forms before birth and persists without replacement. The extent to which adult neurogenesis exists in humans, and its contribution to cognition are controversial, with conflicting reports published in 2018.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kempermann G, Gage FH, Aigner L, Song H, Curtis MA, Thuret S, Kuhn HG, Jessberger S, Frankland PW, Cameron HA, Gould E, Hen R, Abrous DN, Toni N, Schinder AF, Zhao X, Lucassen PJ, Frisén J | title = Human Adult Neurogenesis: Evidence and Remaining Questions | journal = Cell Stem Cell | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–30 | date = July 2018 | pmid = 29681514 | pmc = 6035081 | doi = 10.1016/j.stem.2018.04.004 }}</ref>

The body contains a variety of stem cell types that have the capacity to differentiate into neurons. Researchers found a way to transform human skin cells into nerve cells using [[transdifferentiation]], in which "cells are forced to adopt new identities".<ref name=twsX33>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/news.2011.328 | last = Callaway | first = Ewen |title= How to make a human neuron | journal = Nature |quote= By transforming cells from human skin into working nerve cells, researchers may have come up with a model for nervous-system diseases and perhaps even regenerative therapies based on cell transplants. The achievement, reported online today in ''Nature'', is the latest in a fast-moving field called transdifferentiation, in which cells are forced to adopt new identities. In the past year, researchers have converted connective tissue cells found in skin into heart cells, blood cells, and liver cells.

During [[neurogenesis]] in the mammalian brain, progenitor and stem cells progress from proliferative divisions to differentiative divisions. This progression leads to the neurons and glia that populate cortical layers. [[Epigenetics|Epigenetic]] modifications play a key role in regulating [[gene expression]] in differentiating [[neural stem cells]], and are critical for cell fate determination in the developing and adult mammalian brain. Epigenetic modifications include [[DNA methylation|DNA cytosine methylation]] to form [[5-methylcytosine]] and [[DNA demethylation|5-methylcytosine demethylation]].<ref name=Wang2016>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang Z, Tang B, He Y, Jin P | title = DNA methylation dynamics in neurogenesis | journal = Epigenomics | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 401–14 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26950681 | pmc = 4864063 | doi = 10.2217/epi.15.119 }}</ref> These modifications are critical for cell fate determination in the developing and adult mammalian brain. [[DNA methylation|DNA cytosine methylation]] is catalyzed by [[DNA methyltransferase|DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs)]]. Methylcytosine demethylation is catalyzed in several stages by [[TET enzymes]] that carry out oxidative reactions (e.g. [[5-methylcytosine]] to [[5-hydroxymethylcytosine]]) and enzymes of the DNA [[base excision repair]] (BER) pathway.<ref name=Wang2016/>

At different stages of mammalian nervous system development two DNA repair processes are employed in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. These pathways are [[homologous recombination]]al repair used in proliferating neural precursor cells, and [[non-homologous end joining]] used mainly at later developmental stages<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Orii KE, Lee Y, Kondo N, McKinnon PJ | title = Selective utilization of nonhomologous end-joining and homologous recombination DNA repair pathways during nervous system development | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 103 | issue = 26 | pages = 10017–22 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16777961 | pmc = 1502498 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0602436103 | bibcode = 2006PNAS..10310017O | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Intercellular communication between developing neurons and [[microglia]] is also indispensable for proper neurogenesis and brain development.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cserép |first1=Csaba |last2=Schwarcz |first2=Anett D. |last3=Pósfai |first3=Balázs |last4=László |first4=Zsófia I. |last5=Kellermayer |first5=Anna |last6=Környei |first6=Zsuzsanna |last7=Kisfali |first7=Máté |last8=Nyerges |first8=Miklós |last9=Lele |first9=Zsolt |last10=Katona |first10=István |title=Microglial control of neuronal development via somatic purinergic junctions |journal=Cell Reports |date=September 2022 |volume=40 |issue=12 |pages=111369 |doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111369|pmid=36130488 |pmc=9513806 |s2cid=252416407 }}</ref>
