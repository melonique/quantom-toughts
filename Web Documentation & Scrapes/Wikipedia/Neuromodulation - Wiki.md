'''Neuromodulation''' is the [[physiology|physiological]] process by which a given [[neuron]] uses one or more chemicals to regulate diverse populations of neurons. Neuromodulators typically bind to [[metabotropic receptor|metabotropic]], [[G protein-coupled receptor|G-protein coupled receptors]] (GPCRs) to initiate a second messenger signaling cascade that induces a broad, long-lasting signal. This modulation can last for hundreds of milliseconds to several minutes. Some of the effects of neuromodulators include: altering intrinsic firing activity,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=DeRiemer|first1=S. A.|last2=Strong|first2=J. A.|last3=Albert|first3=K.

==Neuromodulatory systems==
{{see also|Neural pathways}}

The major [[neurotransmitter systems]] are the [[noradrenaline]] (norepinephrine) system, the [[dopamine]] system, the [[serotonin]] system, and the [[cholinergic]] system. Drugs targeting the neurotransmitter of such systems affect the whole system, which explains the mode of action of many drugs.

Most other neurotransmitters, on the other hand, e.g. [[glutamate]], [[GABA]] and [[glycine]], are used very generally throughout the central nervous system.

===Noradrenaline system===
{{Further|Norepinephrine#Norepinephrine system}}

The noradrenaline system consists of around 15,000 neurons, primarily in the [[locus coeruleus]].<ref name=SaraNeuron>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sara SJ, Bouret S |title=Orienting and reorienting: the locus coeruleus mediates cognition through arousal |journal=Neuron |volume=76 |issue=1 |pages=130–41 |year=2012 |pmid=23040811 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2012.09.011 |doi-access=free }}</ref> This is diminutive compared to the more than 100 billion neurons in the brain. As with dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra,  neurons in the locus coeruleus tend to be [[melanin]]-pigmented. [[Noradrenaline]] is released from the neurons, and acts on [[adrenergic receptor]]s. Noradrenaline is often released steadily so that it can prepare the supporting glial cells for calibrated responses. Despite containing a relatively small number of neurons, when activated, the noradrenaline system plays major roles in the brain including involvement in suppression of the neuroinflammatory response, stimulation of neuronal plasticity through LTP, regulation of glutamate uptake by astrocytes and LTD, and consolidation of memory.<ref name="pmid22717696">{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Donnell J, Zeppenfeld D, McConnell E, Pena S, Nedergaard M | title = Norepinephrine: a neuromodulator that boosts the function of multiple cell types to optimize CNS performance | journal = Neurochem. Res. | volume = 37 | issue = 11 | pages = 2496–512 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 22717696 | pmc = 3548657 | doi = 10.1007/s11064-012-0818-x }}</ref>

===Dopamine system===
{{Further|Dopamine#Functions in the brain}}

The dopamine or dopaminergic system consists of several pathways, originating from the [[ventral tegmentum]] or [[substantia nigra]] as examples. It acts on [[dopamine receptor]]s.<ref name="pmid15177784">{{cite journal | last = Scheler| first= G. | title = Regulation of neuromodulator receptor efficacy--implications for whole-neuron and synaptic plasticity. | journal = Prog. Neurobiol. | volume = 72 | issue = 6| pages = 399–415 | date = 2004 | pmid = 15177784 | doi = 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2004.03.008  | arxiv = q-bio/0401039 | bibcode= 2004q.bio.....1039S | s2cid= 9353254 }}</ref>

[[Parkinson's disease]] is at least in part related to dropping out of dopaminergic cells in [[deep-brain nuclei]], primarily the melanin-pigmented neurons in the [[substantia nigra]] but secondarily the noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus. Treatments potentiating the effect of dopamine precursors have been proposed and effected, with moderate success.

====Dopamine pharmacology====
* [[Cocaine]], for example, blocks the [[reuptake]] of [[dopamine]], leaving these neurotransmitters in the [[synapse|synaptic gap]] for longer.
* [[AMPT]] prevents the conversion of tyrosine to [[L-DOPA]], the precursor to dopamine; [[reserpine]] prevents dopamine storage within [[Synaptic vesicle|vesicles]]; and [[deprenyl]] inhibits [[monoamine oxidase]] (MAO)-B and thus increases dopamine levels.

===Serotonin system===
{{Further|Serotonin#Gross anatomy}}

The serotonin created by the brain comprises around 10% of total body serotonin. The majority (80-90%) is found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McIntosh|first1=James|title=What is serotonin?

* [[Tricyclic antidepressants]] also block reuptake of biogenic amines from the synapse, but may primarily effect serotonin or norepinephrine or both.

* [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitors]] allow reuptake of biogenic amine neurotransmitters from the synapse, but inhibit an [[Monoamine oxidase|enzyme]] which normally destroys (metabolizes) some of the transmitters after their reuptake.

Although changes in neurochemistry are found immediately after taking these antidepressants, symptoms may not begin to improve until several weeks after administration. Increased transmitter levels in the synapse alone does not relieve the depression or anxiety.<ref name="Kandel" /><ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

===Cholinergic system===
The cholinergic system consists of projection neurons from the [[pedunculopontine nucleus]], [[laterodorsal tegmental nucleus]], and [[basal forebrain]] and interneurons from the striatum and nucleus accumbens. It is not yet clear whether acetylcholine as a neuromodulator acts through [[volume transmission]] or classical synaptic transmission, as there is evidence to support both theories. Acetylcholine binds to both metabotropic [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor|muscarinic receptors]] (mAChR) and the ionotropic [[Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor|nicotinic receptors]] (nAChR). The cholinergic system has been found to be involved in responding to cues related to the reward pathway, enhancing signal detection and sensory attention, regulating homeostasis, mediating the stress response, and encoding the formation of memories.<ref name="pmid23040810">{{cite journal | vauthors = Picciotto MR, Higley MJ, Mineur YS | title = Acetylcholine as a neuromodulator: cholinergic signaling shapes nervous system function and behavior | journal = Neuron | volume = 76 | issue = 1 | pages = 116–29 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 23040810 | pmc = 3466476 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2012.08.036 }}</ref><ref name="pmid20668433">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hasselmo ME, Sarter M | title = Modes and models of forebrain cholinergic neuromodulation of cognition | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 52–73 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 20668433 | pmc = 2992803 | doi = 10.1038/npp.2010.104 }}</ref>

===GABA===
[[Gamma-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA) has an inhibitory effect on brain and spinal cord activity.<ref name="Kandel" />

===Neuropeptides===
[[Neuropeptide]]s are small proteins used for communication in the nervous system. Neuropeptides represent the most diverse class of signaling molecules. There are 90 known genes that encode human neuropeptide precursors. In invertebrates, there are ~50 known genes encoding neuropeptide precursors.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Nässel|first1=Dick R.|last2=Zandawala|first2=Meet|date=2019-08-01|title=Recent advances in neuropeptide signaling in Drosophila, from genes to physiology and behavior|journal=Progress in Neurobiology|volume=179|pages=101607|doi=10.1016/j.pneurobio.2019.02.003|pmid=30905728|s2cid=84846652|issn=0301-0082}}</ref> Most neuropeptides bind to G-protein coupled receptors, however some neuropeptides directly gate ion channels or act through kinase receptors.

==Neuromuscular systems==
Neuromodulators may alter the output of a physiological system by acting on the associated inputs (for instance, [[central pattern generator]]s).  However, modeling work suggests that this alone is insufficient,<ref name="Stern">{{cite journal|last=Stern|first=E|author2=Fort TJ|author3=Millier MW|author4=Peskin CS|author5=Brezina V|year=2007|title=Decoding modulation of the neuromuscular transform|journal=Neurocomputing|volume=70|issue=6954|pages=1753–1758|doi=10.1016/j.neucom.2006.10.117|pmc=2745187|pmid=19763188}}</ref> because the neuromuscular transformation from neural input to muscular output may be tuned for particular ranges of input. Stern et al. (2007) suggest that neuromodulators must act not only on the input system but must change the transformation itself to produce the proper  contractions of muscles as output.<ref name="Stern" />

==Other uses==
Neuromodulation also refers to an emerging class of medical therapies that target the nervous system for restoration of function (such as in [[cochlear implants]]), relief of pain, or control of symptoms, such as tremor seen in movement disorders like [[Parkinson's disease]]. The therapies consist primarily of targeted electrical stimulation, or infusion of medications into the cerebrospinal fluid using intrathecal drug delivery, such as [[baclofen]] for [[spasticity]]. Electrical stimulation devices include [[deep brain stimulation]] systems (DBS), colloquially referred to as "brain pacemakers", [[spinal cord stimulator]]s (SCS) and [[Vagus nerve stimulation|vagus nerve stimulators]] (VNS), which are implanted using minimally invasive procedures, or [[transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation]] and [[scrambler therapy]] devices, which are fully external, among others.<ref>{{cite book |title=Neuromodulation, Vol. 1-2 |editor1-first=Elliot S. |editor1-last=Krames |editor2-link=Paul Hunter Peckham |editor2-first=P.
