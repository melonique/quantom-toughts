Do you feel like this applies to you? This quote resonated with me a lot, I always felt like the black sheep of the family (or maybe I’m just trying to feel special) and I always feel like I notice what’s wrong with my family that the rest of them don’t. Like if I feel like I’m being disrespected in some way and I don’t want to participate in it then I look like I don’t want to talk to my family or care about them. Or I don’t want to play the “role” they have of me in their head so I distance myself a lot from them. I’m pretty sensitive and always feel too much. I don’t know why, I don’t like it. It just gets in the way of doing things. This quote made me feel a little better like my life had a bigger purpose than just sitting here in anxiety, fear, depression, guilt, etc.

If you haven’t already, check out Gabor Mate . I think we all feel it but we don’t understand it . We just spend most of our life being emotionally shut down till we understand the cycle of generational trauma. Trauma just doesn’t just mean actual big acts it can also include child rearing practises where the child’s emotional needs were not met . Which tbh is most of us . Now is the time to spend time healing yourself and learning . Don’t blame your family, they were just victims in the cycle . If anyone is contemplating having a child they should complete the Circle Of Security parenting course . Let’s do better for our children and ourselves .

It's a powerful quote. True not just of families... But any group.

What it is saying to me is that till someone processes the emotion with awarenes....the emotion just keep getting transferred from one to the other.

Seems to me like you're in awareness of your emotions. Let that awareness strengthen. From it, great strength will also come.

It's a good quote. I would go a little further from the experience of my family and me. I think they felt the pain that was transferred through time and generations but they were not ready to face it. To look closely and to accept it, embrace it and heal it.
